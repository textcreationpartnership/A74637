            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is obſerved of this Empire, that it hath a <hi>Watery</hi> conſtitution, for, <hi>A Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent</hi> (the miſtris of moiſt bodies) is it's badge, or coat-armour. Alſo the Prophet <hi>Jſajah</hi> in ch. <hi>27.1.</hi> calls it <hi>The Dragon in the Sea</hi> (of which <hi>Egypt</hi> was a type, which is ſituate among many waters). And <hi>Ranzovius</hi> obſerves, that <hi>a watery trigon</hi> hath favoured <hi>Mahomets</hi> Law, and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; for at his ariſe, when he invented his <hi>Alchoran,</hi> and began his <hi>Sarracen</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>a watery trigon</hi> had dominion; About the year <hi>1385</hi> the Turks much prevailed in Chriſtendome under the return of the ſame <hi>trigon;</hi> and it ſtill rules. But ere long (ſayth he) <hi>a fiery trigon</hi> ſhall raign, which will bring a totall ruine to that Government.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures foretell of this Empire too and that under ſeverall Names; as alſo of it's fall. <hi>I ſay</hi> calls it in ch. <hi>27.1. Livia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi> and <hi>The Dragon;</hi> and it is <hi>to be puniſhed with Gods great, ſore, and</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:169729:9"/>
               <hi>ſtrong ſword;</hi> and this is to be done when his people The <hi>Jew's</hi> do own the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who then ſhall be put into a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, or ſinging, as in <hi>Jſay.</hi> ch. <hi>25.</hi> and ch. <hi>26.</hi> In <hi>Ezech.</hi> ch. <hi>38.</hi> and ch. <hi>39.</hi> it is called <hi>Gog, and Magog:</hi> for in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets time, that was the name of thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of whom the nation of the <hi>Turks</hi> are ſince deſcended. And <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> is to fall upon the mountains of <hi>Jſrael,</hi> where he is to receive his fatall blow. In <hi>Dan. 7.8.</hi> he is called <hi>The little Horn,</hi> before whom three of the firſt horns were plucked up by the roots; and which had a mouth ſpeaking great things: but this Horn, with all his ſtrength, ſhall be broken, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>The Ancient of Days.</hi> In <hi>Apoc. 9.14.</hi> it's expreſſed by <hi>The four Angels which are bound in the great river</hi> Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates. And in v. <hi>16.</hi> it's called <hi>An Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Horſemen.</hi> And in <hi>Apoc. 16.13.</hi> it's expreſſed by <hi>The Dragon:</hi> which in apocalypticall notion imports An open e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy againſt Chriſt, and his Saints: now this Dragon ſhall be bound, and caſt into the bottomleſſe pit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:169729:9"/>
Concerning <hi>The Time</hi> when this ſhall be, divers are the opinions. For a generall compute, I think it may ſtrongly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That the ſecond Wo-Trumpet (which conteins the <hi>Turks</hi> duration, as the firſt doth the <hi>Sarracen</hi> Kingdome) doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporize with the firſt <hi>6</hi> vials; ſo that while thoſe are powring forth, this Empire hath it's dominion; and ſhall expire with them which will be, when the <hi>42</hi> months ſhall be ended. And for a more particular account, moſt follow that of expounding the <hi>1290</hi> days, in <hi>Dan. 12.11.</hi> and the <hi>1335.</hi> in verſ. <hi>12.</hi> to be meant of the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance by the ruine of the <hi>Turks;</hi> and that the firſt number (making the <hi>epocha</hi> to be in an. <hi>360.)</hi> comes out in an. <hi>1650.</hi> when it ſhall begin; and the foundation be laid of the <hi>Jews</hi> converſion, and of the <hi>Turks</hi> deſtruction. And the laſt to to come out in an. <hi>1695.</hi> when both the fore-named particulars ſhall be compleated. And to the ſame ſenſe is that fitted of an <hi>Hour, a Day a Month, and a year,</hi> in <hi>Apoc<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.15.</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it about <hi>395</hi> years, and to import the duration of the Turkiſh Empire, which
<pb facs="tcp:169729:10"/>
(they ſay) began in an. <hi>1300.</hi> Now that this interpretation in a ſtrict ſenſe, is not true, time hath proved; for the 1650th year is gone, and yet neither of theſe two, (ſo far as we know) is ſo much as begun; though perhaps we are nearer to it then we think for, The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay, God keeps three keys in his own hand, ſc. that <hi>Of the Womb, Of the Clouds, and of the Grave:</hi> I may add a 4th, ſc. that <hi>Of the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> of which we underſtand ſo little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly. But we humbly wait, when the father of Lights ſhall break forth upon us with the ſpirit of Illumination.</p>
            <p>For <hi>the Perſons by whom</hi> this ſhalbe effected. Moſt think it ſhall be by the <hi>Jews,</hi> thoſe Kings of the Eaſt, whom ere long God will gather from their great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion, and call out of their holes; who when ſo miraculouſly called, and gathered of God, he will dry up the waters of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> before them, and alſo deſtroy the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> power by them, making them a terror to his enemies, and a bleſſing to all his people; ſutable to this, the <hi>Turks</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (as <hi>Purchas</hi> ſayth) have this Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:169729:10"/>
That they ſhall laſt of all be ſubdued by the children of <hi>Jſaac,</hi> Which if ſo, then look not for the ſetting of the <hi>Half Moon,</hi> till the riſing of <hi>the Sun;</hi> not for the fall of the <hi>Turks,</hi> till the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall ariſe, and ſhine in glory, by the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt to them, and with them.</p>
            <p>As for it's <hi>Religion,</hi> it's calculated for an ignorant, ſlaviſh, theeviſh, and ſenſuall people; ſuch as the <hi>Arabians</hi> formerly were, and the <hi>Turks</hi> now are. Wheras the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt hath it's ariſe from the ſpirit of Freedom, and Liberty; it comes from the free ſpirit, it takes place chiefly in a free people, and makes them more free who embrace it in power, as in <hi>Joh. 8.36.</hi> Which may be one accidentall cauſe of the Goſpels prevailing in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> more than in any other part of the world, becauſe we are the freeſt of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But this, I think, I am ſure of, That the doctrine of Chriſt ſhall not ſubdue the world to it ſelf, till the time comes, when Tyranny and Slavery ſhall be huſh'd out of the world, and Liberty ſhall be given uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally to mankind.</p>

Before I ſpeak of <hi>Mahomets Alchoran,</hi> I muſt ſpeak ſomwhat of <hi>Mahomet</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (though the leſs, becauſe ſo many have writ ſo largely of him.) He was born in <hi>Arabia,</hi> in an. <hi>620.</hi> in a ſmall village named <hi>Jeſrab,</hi> but now <hi>Medinah Alnabi.</hi> His father was <hi>Abdalla</hi> the ſon of <hi>Abdal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutalib,</hi> a worſhipper of Idols. His mother was <hi>Emina,</hi> a Jeweſs, and of ill repute. His father dying, and his mother being left ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poor, ſhee not able to keep him, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to an unkle; but he caſting him off, the young <hi>Mahomet</hi> was a prey to Theevs, who (as <hi>Baudier</hi> relates) put him into chains, among other Slaves; and in that quality being ſet to ſale, a rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant <hi>Abdemonople</hi> bought him. He trading for his maſter, got his good-will; and his maſter dying, he married his rich widow; by which mean he grew rich, and more ambitious. His ambition prompted him to be ſome great man, and by the help of <hi>Sergius</hi> a Neſtorian Monk, he would be thought to be a Prophet; to gaine the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of which, he gave out That he did many Miracles, That he had conference
<pb facs="tcp:169729:11"/>
with the angell <hi>Gabriell;</hi> That God gave him the <hi>Alchoran;</hi> and That the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit came to him in the ſhape of a Pigeon. But not to ſpend time in a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing theſe forgeries; a ſhort deſcription of his life will do it ſufficiently; which I ſhall borrow out of <hi>Baudier,</hi> his <hi>Hiſtoire de la-Religion des Turcs. Mahomet</hi> was a famous high-way thief, robbing the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravans of Merchants as they travelled from one Country to another; by whom he was ſometimes wounded; ſometimes ſome of his companions were ſlain, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he ſucceeded too well for ſo bad a cauſe: To this he added Cruelty, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cring thoſe who oppoſed his thieving, when it lay in his power. He is truly infamous for his unbridled Luſt, having fifteen Wives, and two Slaves that were his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubines. Now by this ſhort Narrative let any man judge, who hath any ſeed of God in him, yea who hath not defaced the light of nature common to Mankind, whether this man be like to be a Prophet of God.</p>
            <p>His Law he calls <hi>Alchoran,</hi> which in the <hi>Arabic</hi> imports, <hi>A gathering together of Precepts:</hi> or <hi>Alfurkan,</hi> which ſignifies
<pb facs="tcp:169729:12"/>
               <hi>Redemption.</hi> It is divided into <hi>Azoara,</hi> or chapters; which word ſignifies <hi>Faces,</hi> becauſe as by the face you know the man: ſo by theſe, as by titles, you know the contents of that diviſion. Theſe <hi>Azoara</hi> are made fewer, or more, according to ſeverall edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and hence it is that the quotations out of the <hi>Alchoran,</hi> mentioned in this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe, do not anſwer the <hi>Azo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ara</hi> of the <hi>Alchoran</hi> as we have it in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. Which the Reader muſt obſerve, leaſt he think that the Author was miſtaken in what he cites. The <hi>Turks</hi> ſay that <hi>their Alchoran was writ upon parchment, made of the skin of the Ram, ſacrificed by</hi> Abraham <hi>to God in ſtead of</hi> Iſaac: ſo <hi>Baudier.</hi> This <hi>Alchoran</hi> cal's itſelf, in ſeverall places, by ſpecious Names, ſc. <hi>The confirmation of the Goſpell: The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation and explication of the old te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: The book of Truth: The book of the converſion of men: The meſſenger of eternall joy: The guide to mans ſalvation: The mother of books: That which leads men from darkneſs to light.</hi> I ſhall not undertake to confute this <hi>Alchoran,</hi> it being ſo well performed by
<pb facs="tcp:169729:12"/>
many, who have made it their Proper work; and alſo by the labour of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert <hi>Moor</hi> in this following diſcourſe. I ſhall only ſay this of it in generall, That it is compoſed of a ſtrange miſcellany, ſc. of Rabbinicall fables; of hiſtories corruptly recited out of the Old Teſtament; and as faſly quoted out of the New. So that what was juſtly ſaid of the Popiſh Legend of their Saints: That he that made it, was a man <hi>Plumbei cordis, et Aeneae frontis,</hi> of a leaden heart, and of a braſen forehead: may moſt properly be applied to this Book.</p>
            <p>It may juſtly be wondred at, that ſo great, and ſo wiſe a people as the <hi>Greeks</hi> bave been, ſhould be given over to ſuch ſtrong deluſions. But beſide the wiſe, and holy councell of God, which muſt ſilence all: this is to be ſaid, That God brought this damnable doctrine upon them for that <hi>they had accounted Chriſt crucified to be but fooliſhnes,</hi> as Paul ſaith. And alſo becauſe that in the times immediatly foregoing the ſpreading of <hi>Mahometan</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that part of the world had given heed to many falſe doctrines, which had
<pb facs="tcp:169729:13"/>
much alienated them from the ſimplicity of the truth in Chriſt. And laſtly becauſe the <hi>Greek</hi> Empire had made it ſelf very guilty before God, and men, by their crying abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of Murder, uncleanneſs, Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Saint worſhip, Senſuality and the like; and through the juſt judgement of God it came to paſſe, that they who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed themſelves ſo groſſely, ſhould be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to a reprobate ſenſe to embrace this fardell of lyes, and ſink of abominations.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the generall apoſtaſy of all that part of the world to <hi>Mahometan</hi> forgeries, yet in Hiſtories I find two men, who being convinced, publiquely declared the impoſture of that Religion. One is out of <hi>Baudier,</hi> in lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>5.</hi> who ſayth, That one of their religious men, <hi>a Taliſman,</hi> came to Conſtantinople in the reign of Baiazet the ſecond, and officiated in their great <hi>Moſque</hi> called <hi>St Sophy,</hi> in the preſence of their Emperour: Who in the midſt of his exerciſe, threw the <hi>Alchoran</hi> which he had in his hand, down at his feet, before all the people; and turning himſelf to the Emperour, he preached to him of <hi>The falſneſs of their Law: The Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures
<pb facs="tcp:169729:13"/>
of Mahomet: and the excellency of the Doctrin of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But the time was not come for their Converſion. The Emperour commanded the Taliſman to be brought out of the Moſque, and to be preſently maſſacred. The other is out of the Turkiſh Hiſtory; where it is ſayd, That in an. <hi>1620.</hi> at <hi>Medina</hi> there was an Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition, which continued for three weeks; and one night there was an horrible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt with thunder and lightning; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, there was ſeen theſe words in the firmament, writ in <hi>Arabian</hi> chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters, <hi>O why will ye believe in Lyes!</hi> Then there was ſeen a woman compaſſed about with the Sun, holding a Book in her hand &amp;c. All being amazed at theſe things, at laſt <hi>a Dervice</hi> (which is a ſtrict religions Order among the <hi>Turks</hi>) ſpake, and declared to the people, How God had ſpoke to the Jews by <hi>Moſes;</hi> to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, by Jeſus Chriſt; and to themſelvs <hi>Arabians,</hi> by <hi>Mahomet:</hi> (after that he ſaid) <hi>But I fear, our Religion will be proved corrupt, and our Prophet an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, whoſe prefixed time of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to his people, is now paſt 40 years
<pb facs="tcp:169729:14"/>
agone, by our account; and then this Chriſt (whom they talk of) ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun, and ſet up his name e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly.</hi> At this the hearers were ſtartled; and they took this <hi>Dervice,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, and tortured him to Death.</p>
            <p>This enſuing book is a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of the work of <hi>Johannes Andreas Maurus,</hi> or in <hi>Engliſh, John-Andrew</hi> a Moor; He wrot in <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> it was after tranſlat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Italian, Latine,</hi> and <hi>French;</hi> and this in <hi>Engliſh</hi> preſented to thee, is out of the <hi>French;</hi> a worke deſired by many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned men, And though there is no feare that the <hi>Alchoran</hi> in Engliſh ſhould do hurt to any of our Nation, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it its own confutation, in regard of it's vanity and falſhood: Yet it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, that that being put into our tongue, this diſcourſe ſhould follow it, which is a Strong, Rational, and cleare Eviction of its wickedneſſe.

Man therefore, who hath his beginning, and comes from God, and by the meanes or help of his workes goeth through the Conditions and Vertues of his End, which is God himſelf, continually deſireth to attayn the

who art the Bound and true End of all beleevers and ſaved ones. Vntill that in the yeare <hi>620.</hi> in the city of <hi>Mecca, Abdalla Matalib</hi> and <hi>Jmina</hi> his wife, Idolaters, deſcended from the Baſtard linage of <hi>Iſmael</hi> the ſon of <hi>Hagar</hi> did beget <hi>the ſon of Contradiction and diſcord,</hi> the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Muhamed,</hi> who when he was come to years of diſcretion; with his wicked Companions <hi>Vbequar, Homar, Hozmen</hi> and his <hi>other ſeaven</hi> ſectarian <hi>Captaines,</hi> began to make the people goe aſtray and wander from the ſimple End and certain way of Salvation, and to open the wayes of error by a falſe worſhip, whereby he hath drawn an Infinite of ſouls to the everlaſting paynes of Hell. Vnto which Worſhip, becauſe it was altogeather ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and given to pleaſures and delights, preſently the three <hi>Arabia's</hi> and all <hi>Egypt</hi> turned aſide, and their <hi>Caliphs and</hi> ſucceſcors have paſſed through and Converted all <hi>Africk,</hi> and from thence the Kingdomes of <hi>Spayn,</hi> almoſt all which they poſſeſſed, with the City of <hi>Sciatinia</hi> in the Kingdome of <hi>Valentia,</hi> where many years after I was borne, and was inſtructed in the ſect of <hi>Muhamed</hi> by <hi>Abdalla</hi> my naturall father, who was <hi>Alfaqui</hi> of that Citie, upon whoſe deceaſe I ſucceeded in his office of <hi>Alfaqui,</hi> wherein a long time I was loſt and went aſtray from the truth, untill that in the year <hi>1487.</hi> (the moſt reverend and no leſſe learned Marqueſſe <hi>Adeſora</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the great Church or Cathedrall of <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:169729:17"/>
where by the will of God (who would ſo have it) and my preaching, an infinite number of <hi>Moores</hi> denying <hi>Muhamed,</hi> were Converted to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> And a little while after I was by their favour created a <hi>Canon,</hi> and was again called by the ſayd Chriſtian Queen <hi>Donna Iſabella,</hi> to come to <hi>Arragon,</hi> for to emplay my ſelf in the Converſion of the <hi>Moores</hi> of that Kingdome, who to the great deſpight and diſhonour of our Crucifyed Saviour, and to the dammage and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of Chriſtian Princes, ſtill to this day periſh in their error; But this her Highneſſes moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intent could not take effect by reaſon of death ſurprizing her; And I, that I might not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main idle ſet my ſelf to tranſlate all the Law of the <hi>Moores,</hi> that is to ſay, The <hi>Alchoran</hi> and the gloſſes thereon, and the <hi>6</hi> bookes of the <hi>ſuné</hi> out of <hi>Arabick</hi> into the <hi>Arragonian</hi> toung, moved thereunto by the command of the right Reverend father <hi>Martyn Garcia</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and Inquiſitor of <hi>Arragon,</hi> my much honoured Lord, to the end that in the Charge which I had from his Grace to preach to the <hi>Moores,</hi> I might Confute and vanquiſh them by the authority of their own Law, which I Could not eaſily have done without tranſlating it.</p>
            <p>Finally, when that was done, that I might not hyde the deſire which God had given mee for their Converſion, I determined to compoſe this preſent treatiſe, (which ſhall be divided into
<pb facs="tcp:169729:17"/>
twelve Chapters) and herein briefly to collect the <hi>fabulous fictions, ridiculous diſcourſes, Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, beſtialities, fooleries, Vilanies, inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies, impoſſibilities, and Contradictions,</hi> which that wicked <hi>Muhamed</hi> hath ſowen and diſperſed in the books of his Sect; thereby to deceive igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, eſpecially in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which he ſayes was revealed to him in one night by an angell in the City of <hi>Meka,</hi> notwithſtanding elſe-where contradicting himſelf, he affirmes that he was <hi>20</hi> years Compoſing it. I have entituled this Work <hi>the Confuſion of Muhamed's Sect,</hi> and my intent in publiſhing it, was that even the weakeſt Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may perceive that in <hi>Muhamed's</hi> Law there is not any groend or reaſon how it can bee true, and that the ignorant <hi>Moores</hi> being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed by the teſtimonies of their own nation, might know the Error wherein they are, and whereunto their falſe Prophet hath led them. I ſay the ignorant, becauſe no men of knowledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them doe beleeve in <hi>Muhamed,</hi> but on the Contrary doe eſteeme their Sect to bee falſe and very beſtiall; and finally to the end that they might all come in to the holy Law and true End for which they were Created; And likewiſe to the end that not onely wiſe Chriſtians, but alſo the weakeſt, knowing the various faith of the <hi>Moores,</hi> on the one hand might laugh at their inſolencyes and beaſtlines, and on the other hand might la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and bewayl their blindneſs and perdition.</p>

Wherefore after this ſaid Treatiſe had been viewed and Corrected by the Reverend Doctors <hi>Mr: Soler</hi> Officiall of <hi>Valentia,</hi> Canon and Dean of <hi>Letida,</hi> and <hi>Mr: Jaſper Pertuſa</hi> Canon of the See of <hi>Valentia,</hi> and <hi>Mr: Jeroſme Fuſter</hi> and <hi>Mr: John Sola</hi> maſters in ſacred Divinity, whereunto <hi>ex abundante</hi> was added the authority of the Right Reverand and noble Lord <hi>Don Mercader</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Tortoſa</hi> and grand Inquiſitor of this Kingdome, I endeavored to have it print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſent into the World for publick good, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating the Curteous Readers, if they find any thing in this Treatiſe well ſpoken, that they would attribute it to God, from Whom it proceeds, and what may bee evill that they impute it to my ſmall knowledge and inſufficiency in the examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and perſuing the whole Treatiſe; which with my ſelf, I Submit to their benign correction, and to the holy Roman Church, as a Catholick, and a faithfull Chriſtian.</p>

the territories of <hi>Mecca;</hi> which the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters afterwards obſerved and kept in reverence to the Idoll which they erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſayd Tower <hi>Elaabba;</hi> And the <hi>Moores</hi> retain and obſerve the ſame Law to this day.

from all the Countrey about <hi>Meka,</hi> they came to viſit this Idoll, and the temple of <hi>Meka,</hi> and to celebrate the ſaid Paſſeover, which feaſt and Pilgrimage is the ſame which the <hi>Moores</hi> now uſe, and have uſed ever ſince <hi>Muhamed's</hi> time, and the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage or viſitation called <hi>Alhage</hi> which the <hi>Moores</hi> now uſe, is the ſame which the Idolaters uſed, and all the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which the Idolaters uſed in the times of Idolatrie, the <hi>Moores</hi> at this day annually uſe the very ſame when they goe to <hi>Meka,</hi> and that by an expreſs command in their Law and ſect; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as the Idolaters did forbear the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling any wild beaſt or bird by hunting in the Countrie of <hi>Meka</hi> fower months of the year, which are 2 before their Paſſeover and 2 after, out of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence they bear to the ſaid Idoll, (yea ſo ſtrickly, that they would not kill a lowſe or a flea, and hence the <hi>Moores</hi> call theſe months <hi>prohibited and forbidden)</hi> the <hi>Moores</hi> do at this preſent uſe and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſame and divers other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:169729:21"/>

               <p>The ſaid book <hi>Azar</hi> aſſirmes, that the ſaid <hi>Caydar</hi> the ſecond ſon of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> was, the man that inſtituted thoſe Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, from which <hi>Caydar Muhamed</hi> deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, and hence this <hi>Caydar</hi> is in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> called <hi>Gead dealharab</hi> (i. e.) grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father of the <hi>Arabians;</hi> That book like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſayth, that the ſaid <hi>Caydar</hi> erected a black ſtone in the ſaid Tower, right againſt the ſaid Idoll, that thoſe who went into the temple might know that the Idoll ſtood in the Tower right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that ſtone, and that in ſtead of the Idoll they ſhould kiſs that ſtone, which was then, and is at this preſent called <hi>The bleſſed ſtone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall elſe-where tell you that <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> worſhiped this ſtone, and magnified it in the temple of the Idoll, and uſed much reverence to it, and in his Law and ſect commandeth that this ſtone be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:169729:22"/>
worſhiped and kiſſed, and that the kiſſing and adoring of this ſtone is an Article of his Law, and that it is at preſent in the ſame place where it was at that time when the Idoll was in being; and I ſhall prove as well by the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and by <hi>Muhamed's ſuné,</hi> That <hi>Muhamed</hi> was an Idolater.</p>
               <p>It appeares plainly that the deſcent of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> from <hi>Caydar</hi> the ſecond ſon of <hi>Iſmael,</hi> unto his parents, was from Idolaters to Idolaters, for the ſpace of 2800 years or there abouts, Now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and tell mee <hi>O Moore,</hi> how that ſaying of <hi>Muhamed</hi> in the book <hi>Kiſed Alanuar</hi> (i. e.) the <hi>book of Flowers,</hi> can be underſtood, where <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſayes that he proceedeth of a moſt perfect ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and that God ſent him in the beſt times of the world; knoweſt thou not, <hi>O Moore,</hi> that during all the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid time of 2800 years, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Cay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar</hi> unto <hi>Muhamed,</hi> that they were all Idolaters; a rude, beaſtly and very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people, as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> teſtifies,

               <p>But let us return to <hi>Muhamed</hi> under the tuition of his nurſe <hi>Alima.</hi> The book <hi>Azar</hi> ſayes, that when <hi>Muhamed</hi> was 4 years old, he went forth on a certain day with the Nurſes ſon to bring home the Cattle, and he being in a field alone the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> came to him in the appearance of a man, cloathed with a garment as white as ſnow, and take<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by the hand led him behind a little hill, and there with a razor lanced his breaſt &amp; cut out his heart, and took a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:169729:24"/>
drop of black matter, which the <hi>Moores</hi> ſay is in every man in the world, and that the devill tempteth men by it; which the Angell took from him that he might not be tempted of the devill at any time, and after it was taken out, the Angell put his heart into his breſt again, and it became whole as it was before; and this the book <hi>Azar</hi> ſayes was the firſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle that <hi>Muhamed</hi> wrought, Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I ſhall make an argument in due place in the Chapter of offences, which ſhall be the ſixth Chapter, and ſo <hi>Muhamed</hi> remayned with his nurſe till he was 16. years old.</p>
               <p>The ſaid book <hi>Azar</hi> ſayes, that when <hi>Muhamed</hi> was 25 years old he took to wife a certaine rich Coſen german of his called <hi>Gadiſa,</hi> which was his firſt wife; This womans former husband was a rich merchant, and kept many Camells and ſlaves, and traded as a Carryer from <hi>Mecca</hi> into <hi>Syria, Perſia,</hi> and <hi>Cayre,</hi> with whom <hi>Muhamed</hi> made ſeverall journies untill he dyed; <hi>Muhamed</hi> and <hi>Gadiſa</hi> liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in wedlock till he was 38
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:169729:24"/>
years old; and <hi>Muhamed</hi> had 3 daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and 1 ſon by her, the eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was called <hi>Fatima,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Zey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neb,</hi> the third <hi>Umicultum,</hi> and his ſon was called <hi>Cazin,</hi> and dyed at 22 years of age.</p>
               <p>The ſame year that <hi>Muhamed</hi> took the ſaid gentle-woman to wife, he did an act of Idolatry, whereby I will prove to the <hi>Moores</hi> that he was an Idolater; and it was thus; Yee muſt underſtand that it chanced that year that the people of <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> repaired a breach which was in the Tower where the ſaid Idoll ſtood, and were conſtrayned to take the Stone from it's place, having repayred the Tower they agreed to put the Stone again in it's place, and to avoyd all ſtrife and offence which might ariſe about which of them ſhould ſet the Stone again in it's place, all the gentry of <hi>Mecca</hi> caſt lots, and the lot fell upon <hi>Muhamed</hi> and a couſen of his, Whereupon <hi>Muhamed</hi> and his couſen came to the Temple to ſet the Stone again it it's place, and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> took off his Turbane from his
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:169729:25"/>
head and he and his couſen layd the Stone upon the Turbane to honour it the more, ſo he on one ſide, &amp; his couſen on the other, took up the Turbane, and with great reverence ſet the ſtone in it's place and kiſſed it with an immenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and in honour to the ſaid Idoll, whence it plainly appeares, that <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> was an Idolater, and did honour and worſhip the Idoll, and kiſſed, magnified and exalted the ſtone, which only thing is of it ſelf great Idolatry.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Muhamed</hi> not only kiſſed and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored this Stone before he was a profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Propher, but alſo kiſſed and adored it after he was a publick Prophet, and he commannds and layes down the ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and kiſſing of this Stone for an Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of his Law and faith, which I prove by the books of the <hi>Suné,</hi> and by a book intituled <hi>Aericele</hi> in the Chapter of the Ceremonies of the <hi>Alhage</hi> or Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, where he ſayes and Commands all the <hi>Moores</hi> which goe a Pilgrimage to <hi>Mecca,</hi> when they goe into the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall of <hi>Mecca</hi> the firſt thing they muſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:169729:25"/>
doe, is to goe to the ſaid Stone, adore it, and kiſſe it on the right ſide. The words in <hi>Arabick</hi> are theſe <hi>Oquahale qulli,</hi> &amp;c. (i. e.) That every <hi>Moore</hi> that goes into the Minſter of <hi>Mecca</hi> muſt firſt ſalute and kiſſe the bleſſed Stone on the right ſide, which Ceremony the Idolaters obſerved in the times when the Idoll was in that Tower <hi>Elcabba,</hi> and to this day the <hi>Moores</hi> obſerve divers other Ceremonies which thoſe Idolaters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in reverence to the Idoll, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Behiram</hi> of the <hi>Aladees</hi> which is after their Paſſeover when they kill the ſheep, the which the ſaid <hi>Caydar,</hi> the <hi>Arabians</hi> grandſire <hi>Iſmael's</hi> ſon, ordayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inſtituted in honour of the Idoll, and in memoriall of the ramme which <hi>Abraham</hi> Sacrificed in ſtead of his ſon <hi>Iſaack,</hi> nothwithſtanding many <hi>Moores,</hi> yea, the moſt part, ſay that it was <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> and not <hi>Iſaack;</hi> but their greateſt Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſay it was <hi>Iſaack.</hi> Likewiſe the <hi>Moores</hi> keep the Ceremony of the <hi>Alhage</hi> (i. e.) Pilgrimage, which they doe once in their lives, And once a yeare in the three
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:169729:26"/>
dayes of the Paſſeover they kill ſheep and divers other beaſts as the Idolaters did, likewiſe the <hi>Moores</hi> forbear hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or killing ſo much as a lowſe or a flee in all the Countrey of <hi>Mecca</hi> during the aforeſaid 4 prohibited months, and ye muſt underſtand that the <hi>Moores</hi> make their account and Calculation of time according to the Lunar year, and not the Solar, and call the twelve <hi>Moones</hi> of the year each by a particular name, whereof 4 are called <hi>Prohibited months</hi> becauſe of the ſaid hunting forbidden them in the Countrey of <hi>Mecca,</hi> which prohibition they retain from <hi>Caydar</hi> and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in honour to the ſaid Idoll, one of theſe months or Moones is called <hi>Rajab,</hi> the next <hi>Quedda,</hi> the third <hi>Hegia,</hi> the laſt <hi>Moharram,</hi> from which <hi>Moharram</hi> they begin their annuall account; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Moores</hi> obſerve the faſt of the tenth day of the ſaid fourth month which begins the year, on which day the Idolaters faſted in reverence to the ſaid Idoll, the which I prove by a ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Muhamed</hi> in the ſixth book of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:169729:26"/>
                  <hi>Suné,</hi> where he ſayes, That the <hi>Coraxiſtes</hi> and the people of <hi>Mecca</hi> faſted this tenth day; when they were Idolaters, and the words in <hi>Arabick</hi> are theſe <hi>Oqua quenet,</hi> &amp;c. Likewiſe the <hi>Moores</hi> obſerve the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Tower called <hi>Elcabba;</hi> and going ſeaven times about a pit called <hi>Birſemſem,</hi> which Ceremony the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters obſerved in memoriall of <hi>Hagar,</hi> and ſaying that when <hi>Hagar</hi> was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of her ſon <hi>Iſmael,</hi> ſhe brought him to this pit and layd him by it, and went to the Temple of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and prayed God to cauſe water to come forth of the ſaid pit; And the Book <hi>Azar</hi> ſayes that <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> went about the Tower, praying to the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and went back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to the well, and did thus ſeaven times, and that hereupon God heard her prayers, and cauſed water to iſſue out of the pit, and for this reaſon, and in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall hereof, the Idolaters went about the Tower, and walked ſeaven times to the well; which Ceremonies the <hi>Moores</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and they are Commaunded ſo to doe, and theſe ceremonies are in <hi>Arabick</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:169729:27"/>
called <hi>Menecique Alhage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They retayn likewiſe another Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Pilgrims goe to <hi>Mecca</hi> and are paſſed a river called in <hi>Arabick Batni Muhacil,</hi> he commands them to caſt Stones on the right hand at the top of a little hill, which Ceremony the Idolaters obſerved, ſaying, that when <hi>Abraham</hi> led his ſon to be Sacrificed, the devill came to this place and told <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> that his father led him away to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and the book <hi>Azar</hi> reports that <hi>Iſmael</hi> took up Stones and flung e'm at the devill; and in memoriall hereof the Idolatrous Pilgrimes uſed to caſt Stones.</p>
               <p>Concerning which ceremonies I will tell the <hi>O Moore,</hi> that although the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters by command from <hi>Caydar</hi> and his Succeſſors, and in reverence of the ſaid Idoll <hi>Allethe Aluza,</hi> did obſerve them, (in honour and memoriall whereof <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> would have them kept, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth all <hi>Moores</hi> to obſerve them) yet he having made a new Religion or Worſhip ought to have inſtituted new
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:169729:27"/>
Ceremonies and not old Ceremonies, yea ſuch as were grounded upon Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and not upon reaſon, ſo that it doth evidently appeare that <hi>Muhamed</hi> did not wholly draw the <hi>Moores</hi> from Idolatry, ſeeing he commands the obſervation of ſo many Ceremonies which are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>Now, leſt we deviate too far from the diſcourſe begun, where I ſaid that <hi>Muhamed</hi> tranſported merchandiſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he was 38 years old, I will proceed to ſhew that he then leſt off trading, and began to lead a <hi>hermeticall</hi> and ſolitary life, and dayly frequented a cave near unto <hi>Mecca,</hi> called in <hi>Arabick Garhera</hi> (i. e.) the cave of <hi>Hera,</hi> where he dayly continued untill evening, but the <hi>Moores</hi> know nothing of what he there did or Spake, onely the book <hi>Azar</hi> ſayes, that he worſhiped the God of heaven, and forbare worſhiping the aforeſaid Idoll.</p>
               <p>The ſaid book <hi>Azar</hi> further relates that <hi>Muhamed</hi> uſed ſo great abſtinence in this cave, that his bodily ſtrength fayled and head aked, inſomuch that his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169729:28"/>
faltered, and he talked Idely, and at laſt loſt his ſence and underſtanding. The ſaid book <hi>Azar</hi> and another book entitled <hi>Azifa</hi> ſay further, that when <hi>Muhamed</hi> was in the ſaid grot, he had many viſions, and heard others ſpeaking of him, and diſcerned the voyce but not the perſon, and continued ſo a long time plainly hearing a voice behind him, but when he turned his face that way he could hear nothing. All which <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> every night told his wife <hi>Gadiſa,</hi> but ſhee told him it was nothing but diabolicall deluſions, and hereby he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came diſtracted and loſt his ſence, and this fury and reviſhment of mind fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him ſo long that one day (the ſaid book ſayes) he reſolved to goe to the precipice of a mountain and deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to caſt himſelf headlong, ſaying that it was better to dye than to be reputed a fool; And <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſayes that when he was in this reſolution the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> came into the ſaid cave in his own form, with white wings, and ſaid to him, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce <hi>O Muhamed,</hi> for God ſendeth thee
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:169729:28"/>
much greeting, and lets thee know that thou ſhalt be his Prophet and meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the moſt perfect of all his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which words in <hi>Arabick</hi> are thus, <hi>Oya Muhamed allah, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) <hi>O Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> God greeteth thee, &amp;c. Moreover the Angell ſaid to him, <hi>O Muhamed,</hi> Read, and he anſwered and ſaid, What ſhall I read? I cannot read; &amp; the Angell replyed to him thus as the <hi>Arabick</hi> runns, Oya <hi>Muhemed acra bizmi,</hi> &amp;c. (i. e.) <hi>O Muhamed</hi> read in the name of thy Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, who created the worme man, read in the name of thy moſt honoured Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who with a pen ſhewes man what he never knew before; and this was the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and ſo the Angell vaniſhed away; And <hi>Muhamed</hi> in the ſixt book of the <hi>Suné,</hi> and namely in the <hi>book of flowers,</hi> ſaid the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in <hi>Arabick, Ofara aytu alme, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> came ſitting in a golden throne between hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and told him the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy and embaſſage; And the book <hi>Azar</hi> ſayes, that when the Angell was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:169729:29"/>
gone, <hi>Muhamed</hi> returned home very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that the beaſts and the trees greeted him, ſaying <hi>Abſir ya Muhamed ine<expan>

It was night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he got home, and calling his wife <hi>Gadiſa,</hi> he told her all the Myſtery re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed by the Angell, and that he was a Prophet and the meſſenger of God, whereupon his wife anſwered him, Alas <hi>Muhamed</hi> I fear it is nothing but the deluſions of Satan, which anſwer much grieved and diſpleaſed <hi>Muhamed,</hi> ſo that he was very penſive for a great while, doubting whether it were a thing from God or a temptation of the Devill, and a great chilneſs and cold ſeazed on him, wherefore caſting himſelf on a bed he commanded his ſervants to cover him well, as they did, and laid divers cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids upon him; and the ſaid book <hi>Azar</hi> relates that as <hi>Muhamed</hi> lay thus, the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> came to him with the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> which is in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus <hi>Oya aynhe at, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:169729:29"/>
Ariſe O thou that art covered, exalt and magnifie thy Creator, and cleanſe thy garments and cloaths, and abhor Idolls; After the Angell had given him this Chapter he vaniſhed, and <hi>Muhamed</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his wife <hi>Gadiſa</hi> read the Chapter to her, nevertheleſs ſhe told him, that ſhe did not beleeve it to be any thing but a fantaſm, and a temptation or deluſion, which was formerly vvont to come upon him; this diſpleaſed <hi>Muhamed</hi> very much, and at mid-night his wife told him further, that if the Angell of God were his freind he would have come again ere this, but becauſe it was not from him, therefore he came not neither would come again. And hereupon <hi>Muhamed</hi> lay all night much troubled at the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell's abſence, Then (ſayes <hi>Azar)</hi> at the dawning of the day the Angell came with the third Chapter, ſaying in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, O guadoha gualleyli, &amp;c.</hi> (i.e.) God ſweares to <hi>Muhamed</hi> by the dawning which brings the day, and by the night which gives darknes, that his Creator hath not forgot him, neither will he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:169729:30"/>
what he hath promiſed him; with which Chapter <hi>Muhamed</hi> recovered his ſtrength, and calling his wife read this Chapter to her, but ſhe told him again, that ſhe would beleeve nothing till ſhe ſaw the Angell with her own eies, and <hi>Muhamed</hi> told her ſhe could not ſee the Angell. Afterwards <hi>Muhamed</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led one of his youths whom he had brought up from a child, whoſe name was <hi>Zeydin,</hi> and told him, That if he would beleeve that he was a Prophet and a meſſenger of God, and would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>Moore,</hi> he would releaſe him and make him a freeman; and revealed all the ſecret of the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> to him; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the youth was content to beleeve <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and become <hi>Moore,</hi> &amp; was the firſt <hi>Moore</hi> that beleeved in <hi>Muhamed.</hi> Then <hi>Muhamed</hi> made a Law and <hi>Suné,</hi> that whatſoever Chriſtian or Jew that was a ſlave, &amp; would become <hi>Moore,</hi> ſhould be ſet free whether his Patron (i. e.) Maſter would yeeld to it or no. This <hi>Zey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> was a ſlave, and bred up by <hi>Muhamed</hi> from his infancy, yea he loved him ſo
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:169729:30"/>
well, that the people of <hi>Mecca</hi> ſaid he was his ſon, and he was called ſo by them all. I will relate the great offence which <hi>Muhamed</hi> did unto this <hi>Zeydin</hi> and his wife in the Chapter of wives.</p>
               <p>All this aforeſaid was done when <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> was 40 years old, ſo that he then began his Sect, and called himſelf a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet in the 40. year of his age, which was the year of our Lord D C and L X, and he was born in the year D C and X X, and dyed in the year 583 ſo that he was 23 years compoſing his ſect or Religion, and lived 63 years.</p>
               <p>After that <hi>Zeydin</hi> his foſter-child was become <hi>Moore, Gadiſa</hi> his wife became <hi>Moore</hi> alſo, and certaine ſlaves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did ſecretly become <hi>Moores;</hi> unto whom <hi>Muhamed</hi> preached privately in his houſe, and made them beleeve that the aforeſaid Idoll was not God but a devill, and a thing made with mens hands, and that there was no other God but the God of heaven, who created hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and who cauſed rain,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:169729:31"/>
and made the earth bring forth all manner of fruites and food for man and beaſt, and made all other Creatures. Alſo he gave them to underſtand that men muſt die, and afterwards riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine at the day of judgement, and give an account to God of all that they have done in this world, and that to the good he would give the glory of Paradiſe, (though the glory which <hi>Muhamed</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth be carnall and full of Vanity, as I ſhall ſhew in this book in a Chapter which handles this point particularly) and to the wicked he would give the paines of hell to eternity; which the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters of <hi>Mecca</hi> denied, affirming that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death there was no reſurrection, and that there was no Paradiſe, nor Hell. And ye muſt underſtand that upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what <hi>Muhamed</hi> affirmed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day of Judgement, Paradiſe, and Hell, and the men of <hi>Mecca</hi> denying the ſame, <hi>Muhamed</hi> compoſed and made certain Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading them that God ſent them to him by the Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and he cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:169729:31"/>
thoſe Chapters to be written in ſcrowles of paper and notes, and gave them to the <hi>Moores</hi> to ruminate them; and afterwards he had them reſtored again to, him and put them in a box cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the box of the Ambaſſage</hi> and <hi>Legate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> and he kept a Secretary for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of whom we ſhall ſpeake hereafter, and after this manner he perverted ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Moores,</hi> who prayed with him, and read the <hi>Alcoran</hi> the moſt ſecretly they could, untill that one of the principal men of <hi>Mecca</hi> called <hi>Homar Alhatas</hi> who was afterwards <hi>Muhamed</hi> his father in Law, became <hi>Moore</hi> or <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> as alſo his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid two Vncles, <hi>Hanza</hi> and <hi>Alabez,</hi> &amp; a neere kinſman of his called <hi>Alibuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib, Muhamed's</hi> ſon-in-Law haveing mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his daughter <hi>Fatima;</hi> and another emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent man of <hi>Mecca</hi> called <hi>Vbechar,</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards alſo <hi>Muhamed's</hi> father-in-Law) All theſe became <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Muſſelmen</hi> on one day, and being men of rank and power, conſulted to manifeſt and publiſh what <hi>Muhamed</hi> kept ſecret, and to pray, &amp;

read the <hi>Alcoran</hi> openly; Whereat <hi>Muhamed's</hi> nine <hi>Vncles</hi> and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Mecca</hi> were extremely inraged, and ſaid that he blaſphemed their Idoll and their God, and the God of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and had made Chapters and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in contempt of him, and that it was a great ſhame to them to ſuffer it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they conſulted together and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to kill him, but being men that regarded their honour, and conſidering that in killing him they ſhould be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diſgraced, (becauſe he was taken for a fool by all the people of <hi>Mecca,</hi> &amp; for one Poſſeſt) therefore they did bear with his folly; For that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>Idiot</hi> an is evident, through the whole <hi>Alcoran,</hi> where he ſayes that his <hi>Vncles</hi> &amp; all others took him for an <hi>Idiot</hi> &amp; a <hi>Demoniake</hi> perſon, and ſaid, in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus, <hi>Oagehele Latihete, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That <hi>Muhamed</hi> Commanded that they ſhould worſhip one God onely, and that he was no other than a Sorcerer or Lyer, and in other Chapters he is called <hi>Meginan,</hi> (i. e.) Poſſeſt of the devill, and there
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:169729:32"/>
are very few Chapters but doe mention that he ſaid himſelf, that he was a lyar and a demoniack rymer, and when he went in the ſtreets all the people of <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> jeered him and mocked him, ſaying one to another, Behold the prophet, Look, there is he that will deſtroy our God; and after this manner <hi>Muhamed</hi> dwelt at <hi>Mecca</hi> ten yeares. Divers men of <hi>Mecca</hi> went a nights to hear the <hi>Moores</hi> read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and made it their Common table talk and laughter, ſaying, that it was old ſtories turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to verſe, as appears in ſeverall Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> which ſay in <hi>Arabick, O in he de ille azatiro alegualin</hi> (i. e.) This is nothing but old tales. Moreover thoſe of <hi>Mecca</hi> ſaid that <hi>Muhamed</hi> had certain Chriſtians, who taught him to make the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as we may ſee in the ſeaventh Chapter of the third book, which in <hi>Arabick</hi> ſayes thus. <hi>Oguacalei, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) This is not the <hi>Alcoran</hi> but a libell which <hi>Muhamed</hi> hath compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hath had ſome perſons which helped him. The gloſſers on the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:169729:33"/>
and the ſaid book <hi>Azar</hi> doth ſay, that thoſewhich helped him were two ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutlers, (Chriſtian ſlaves unto one of <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca)</hi> who knew much of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; with theſe <hi>Muhamed</hi> converſed, and queſtioned them about many things of the Bible, of which they reſolved him, and upon this ſurmiſe they report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he asked theſe two Cutlers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe things which he did not certainly know, and as they anſwered ſo he ſet it down in <hi>Arabick</hi> in the ſcrowles, and perſwaded the <hi>Moores</hi> that God ſent them to him by the Angell <hi>Gabriel;</hi> and indeed there is great reaſon to beleeve this, becauſe in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> there are ſo many contrarieties, unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſtories, and fables, all which hapned through thoſe Cutlers, who told him what themſelves did not certainly know, and as they ſaid, ſo he wrote in his tablebooks and papers, and that hence it is that he doth ſo vary and change verſes, and ſets down ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trareities in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and things which agree not together. And indeed
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:169729:33"/>
the <hi>Alcoran</hi> doth erre in Philoſophy, Logick and Aſtrologie, becauſe the Cutlers ſpake not truth, neither were Logicians, Aſtrologers, nor Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers. Likewiſe thoſe of <hi>Mecca</hi> ſaid that he kept a Chriſtian who taught him to make the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and others ſaid it was a <hi>Jewe,</hi> ſo that the people of <hi>Mecca</hi> had all theſe Suſpitions of him, during the ten years that he dwelt at <hi>Mecca.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards when <hi>Muhamed's</hi> Vncles, and the chiefeſt of the gentry of <hi>Mecca</hi> (which were the <hi>Corexirtes, Haximiſtes and Benitamins,</hi> three very potent and rich families) ſaw that he perverted many, and that the ſect encreaſed and grew to a head, they aſſembled one night in the houſe of one of the moſt eminent amongſt them, and held coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell about <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to kill him, empriſon him, or at leaſt to baniſh him; and that this was ſo conſulted of, wee may read in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapter of the ſecond book, which in <hi>Arabick</hi> ſayes thus <hi>Ognaid pamcoro, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That they of <hi>Mecca</hi> took
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:169729:34"/>
Counſell to kill him, or to ſend him into baniſhment, or to impriſon him. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo in conſultation, certain men who were ſecretly become <hi>Moores,</hi> did the ſame night give <hi>Muhamed</hi> notice of it, and he preſently fled, and all the <hi>Moores</hi> with him, and went to <hi>Medina,</hi> a City ten dayes journey from <hi>Mecca.</hi> He had alſo notice of the preparations of the Citizens of <hi>Mecca</hi> who had ſet guards in the wayes, perceiving that he and his <hi>Moores</hi> would flee away that night; whereupon <hi>Muhamed</hi> bid all the <hi>Moores,</hi> that every one ſhould lay a handfull of embers on the heads of his horſe, and caſt another handful into the ayr, and tye the raynes of their horſes, reading a verſe which is in the 18th. Chapter of the third book of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and is thus <hi>Oguaihalme minbeym, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That they tooke a vayl or skreen in their hands and about them, ſo that they blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them and they ſaw nothing; And the book <hi>Azar</hi> ſayes that by the Embers which were laid over the horſes heads and by repeating the ſaid verſe, the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:169729:34"/>
                  <hi>Moores</hi> and he, paſſed through their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and were not perceived, and ſo they went to <hi>Medina,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Tribik,</hi> where he was received for a Prophet, and there dwelt thirteen years, there finiſhed his ſect or religion and dyed there. At <hi>Medina</hi> he found five families of <hi>Jews,</hi> dwelling there and in the parts adjacent, who began to diſpute and queſtion thoſe things which he had then inſerted in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to doe ſome miracles as <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets deceaſed had done; to whom he anſwered, That God was his witnes, and that his teſtimony ought to ſuffice, and that he came not to work miracles but to reduce thoſe which wandered and went aſtray, unto the Law of God and of <hi>Abraham;</hi> of which queſtions and anſwers the Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> are full, and in many Chapters he excuſeth himſelf of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, alleging unto the <hi>Jewes</hi> that divers meſſengers, and Prophets wrought miracles and yet were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved, yea that thoſe Prophets ſuffered
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:169729:35"/>
perſecution, and with this excuſe he quotes in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> the names of divers men which were never heard of, nor are named any where els<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There he relates the hiſtory of a Prophet called <hi>Hadin</hi> alias <hi>Had,</hi> and of another called <hi>Zamud</hi> alias <hi>Hud,</hi> and of a third called <hi>Zaleh,</hi> and of their nation called <hi>the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Hud,</hi> and of a camell who with her foale was a League in length, which two beaſts one day drank up the water of the City where that people dwelt, and the next day ſwallowed up men; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one day they of the City ſlew them, and becauſe of the ſin in killing them, there fell a great tempeſt upon that people.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Muhamed</hi> had great diſputing and debating with the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf extolled their Law, that ſo they might be ſilent, nevertheleſs they ſtill diſputed againſt him, and laughed at the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Muſſellmen,</hi> and ſet ſtrife betwixt him and his <hi>Moores,</hi> as ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in due place, which jarring conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued untill he got power, and then he
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169729:35"/>
began to ſuppreſs the <hi>Jews,</hi> and fought eleven battailes with them, overcame them, and ſlew moſt part of them, and the ſurvivors had their lives given them by the <hi>Moores,</hi> and became their ſubjects and tributaries; and from thence for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he began to combate againſt the people of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and they of <hi>Mecca</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him as ſhall be ſhewen hereafter; But that I may not be tedious I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Chapter, and running through the eleven following Chapters I ſhall finiſh this treatiſe, and the life of <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> and of all that he did whilſt he was at <hi>Almedina.</hi>

                     <hi>The ſecond chapter treateth of the</hi> Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, <hi>what it ſignifies, of the matters therein contained, and of how many ſongs it is compoſed; who collected it, and reduced it into four books, in the order it is now in, and how many years</hi> Muhamed <hi>was making it, how it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins and ends, and which are the firſt and laſt chapters</hi>

                  <hi>ALcoran</hi> ſignifies a leſſon or Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Chapters or ſongs, though it be alſo called by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name <hi>Alforzan</hi> (i. e.) <hi>ſcattered ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and Chapters, becauſe he was ſo long in making it, and the Chapters thereof are called <hi>ſuar,</hi> and one alone is called in <hi>Arabick Surah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Alcoran</hi> treateth of divers things, and eſpecially of the Sect or Law of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and of what the <hi>Moores</hi> ſhould beleeve and doe, of the hope of reward in the world to come for the Good, and of torment for the Wicked,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:169729:36"/>
It alſo treateth of things permitted and forbidden to the <hi>Moores,</hi> aſwell of food and drink, as of women with whom they may or may not marry; alſo it ſpeaks of the Creation of the world, how God Created <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> how they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and were caſt out of Paradiſe and came to the earth; how the evill Angells ſinned, and what was the cauſe of their ſin, and how they loſt the Caeleſtiall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; It alſo ſpeaks how God ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to bring the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the Captivity and power of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> how the <hi>Jewes</hi> received the Law; what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell them at their going out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> how they had <hi>Manna,</hi> ſinned, and worſhiped the calf, and how they paſſed the red ſea, wherein <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; It alſo treateth of divers other hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; (although he hath put them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly and out of order, as the Cutlers related them.) It alſo ſpeaks of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the old Teſtament, (although he mentions divers which are not nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any author;) It likewiſe contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the admonitions which <hi>Muhamed</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:169729:37"/>
uſed to the people of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and his threats to induce them to beleeve his Sect. It alſo ſpeaks of glory, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſeth of the glory which the <hi>Moores</hi> ſhall have in Paradiſe, as alſo of Hell, and of the paines and torments which are there. It ſpeaks of the wonders which God dayly doth and of the myſteries and divine works which we dayly ſee in the heaven, earth and ſea. It alſo ſpeaks of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> our Lord, of the myſteries of his nativity and life, and of the miracles that he wrought, and of the Euangeliſts, and of the true Law which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath given us, as it ſhall fully appeare in the eleventh Chapter of this Treatiſe. Furthermore the <hi>Alcoran</hi> mentions divers frauds and much filthineſs uſed by <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and divers contrarieties and repugnancies which have no reaſon in them, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers excuſes which God accepted from <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and made for him upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall diſhoneſt and immodeſt caſes which <hi>Muhamed</hi> committed in his life, as wee ſhall ſhew in the Chapter of <hi>Offences</hi> and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:169729:37"/>
                  <hi>Wives.</hi> Finally in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> are many examples of Iudgements, wherewith God chaſtiſed men in old time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſins. Of every thing in order.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Alcoran</hi> was begun in <hi>Mecca</hi> in the year of our Lord, 630. which was the fortieth year of the ſaid <hi>Muhamed's</hi> age; the firſt Chapter thereof was that which the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> gave him in the cave, when he ſaid, read, <hi>O Muhamed,</hi> which Chapter is called <hi>The Chapter of the pen,</hi> and the laſt Chapter was made at <hi>Medina,</hi> and is called <hi>The Chapter of fate</hi> (i. e.) the Conqueſt, and the laſt verſe was that which ſayes; <hi>O college,</hi> &amp;c. (i e) <hi>O Muhamed</hi> tell the <hi>Moores</hi> that nothing is forbidden them to be eaten or drunk, except murrain, bloud, and ſwynes fleſh, upon which verſe I ſhall make an argument hereafter in the tenth Chapter of this treatiſe. This ſaid verſe is now written in the fourth Chapter of the firſt book, called <hi>the Chapter of beaſts.</hi> During the ten years at <hi>Mecca</hi> he made certain Chapters or
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:169729:38"/>
                  <hi>Soré,</hi> which called <hi>Aſoar Mikia</hi> (i. e.) Chapters or ſongs made at <hi>Mecca;</hi> and during the eleaven years that he dwelt at <hi>Almedina</hi> he made the other Chapters called <hi>Soar Medina</hi> (i. e.) ſongs made in <hi>Medina</hi> and not at <hi>Mecca,</hi> ſo that thoſe which were made at <hi>Mecca</hi> were not made at <hi>Medina.</hi> And he doth not make this diſtinction without cauſe, whereof I ſhall ſpeak ere long in dew place. Now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he could not write, he kept a Clark or Secretary who wrot the ſcrowls of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> for him, and <hi>Muhamed</hi> gave out that the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> came to him from time to time with the verſes of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which God ſent him as occaſion required, and as ſoon as the Angell had privately told him the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he preſently commanded his clark to write them in a Scrowl or note, and to give them unto the <hi>Moores</hi> to learn them by heart, and afterwards he took them again, and put them into the ſaid ſhrine or box of the <hi>Menſegina;</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he took a Secretary called <hi>Abdalla Celen,</hi> who before was a <hi>Jewe,</hi> and this
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:169729:38"/>
man was his Secretary ten years, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he had formerly been a <hi>Jew,</hi> and well read and inſtructed in the Law of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he at laſt perceived and took notice that all that <hi>Muhamed</hi> dictat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him was forged, and not given by God; yet notwithſtanding, he would and did make triall of it for his ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it was thus, whenſoever he was commanded to write ſuch and ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he would turne the end of the verſe to another meaning, changing the words and order, but not the rime, nor conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; (For, ye muſt underſtand that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is all in rime and conſonance of meeter,) ſo that when he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to write at the end of a verſe <hi>alla hazizum haquimun,</hi> he wrote <hi>alla cemilum halimum;</hi> that is, when <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> commanded him to write, <hi>God is gracious and wiſe</hi> the ſaid ſecretary wrot <hi>God is a hearer and Judge;</hi> And when he bad him write that <hi>God was Almighty and moſt high</hi> he would ſet down that <hi>God was mercifull and gracious;</hi> and thus the ſaid ſecretary continued ſeven years
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:169729:39"/>
changing the end of the verſes; and when they were changed <hi>Muhamed</hi> did not perceive it, whereupon the Secretary concluded, that if it were a thing from God, ſo much time would not have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed but <hi>Muhamed</hi> would have had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, either from God or from his friend the Angell, All which I prove from the book called <hi>Azzifa,</hi> and by the book <hi>Azear;</hi> ſo the ſecretary ſeeing this, renounced his office, and turned <hi>Jew</hi> again as he was at firſt; and the ſaid books ſay, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſecretary who alſo renounced his office upon the ſame reaſon.</p>
               <p>Now ſpeak <hi>O Moore,</hi> and conſider, what a Law yee have in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and how doe yee obſerve it? yea if a <hi>Moore</hi> change a letter, or corrupt a clauſe, or correct one accent of it, he muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſtoned by the Law and <hi>Suné;</hi> How came it to paſſe that <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo many verſes to be changed, and in ſo many years could not perceive that the <hi>Jew</hi> abuſed him; but gave out himſelf to bee <hi>the greateſt Prophet</hi> that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:169729:39"/>
ever came into the world? and ſo thou wilt come to know that if the <hi>Alcoran</hi> had been ſent from God to <hi>Muhamed</hi> by an Angell, he would have been inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and have had notice of this aforeſaid, and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> would have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and the <hi>Jew</hi> puniſht &amp; chaſtiſed; But in regard hee was neither Prophet, nor the <hi>Alcoran</hi> the word of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Jew</hi> proceeded, altering the verſes at his pleaſure, and <hi>Muhamed</hi> knew not of it;</p>
               <p>Divers <hi>Moores</hi> took offence, when he cauſed the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to be written, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, that one day he would cauſe verſes to be ſet down commanding ſome and forbidding other things, and another day he would dictate and cauſe other verſes to be written, forbidding what he had before allowed and permitted them, and making that Lawfull which he had before forbidden; and thus yee ſhall find in the <hi>Alcoran, above one hundred and fifty verſes of thoſe contrarieties and repugnancies,</hi> which are called <hi>revoked verſes,</hi> becauſe they are revoked and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169729:40"/>
annulled by other verſes, called <hi>revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory verſes,</hi> which they expreſſe in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> by <hi>Hacen,</hi> and <hi>Mauſoh,</hi> Moreover <hi>Muhamed</hi> injoyned the <hi>Moores</hi> to read certaine verſes, and this rumination of verſes continued a year or two, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they forgot them, and when they told <hi>Muhamed</hi> that they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got their verſes, and deſired him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peate them again to them, it ſeemes he could not remember them himſelf, and he would anſwer them that God made him forget them; but the <hi>Moores</hi> reproved him and told him that if they were verſes from God, he ought not to forget them, and if he could not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, why did he not get them to be inſpired into him again, ſeeing his friend the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> converſed with him; but he on the contrary inſtituted a verſe to reprove them, in the firſt Chapter of the firſt book, which ſayes in <hi>Arabick: Omenen Zehamin, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That God doth not ſuffer any verſe to be revoaked or forgotten, but for to ſend another like it, or a better, as if he would ſay, that the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169729:40"/>
verſes lately forgotten could not be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to remembrance again, becauſe God had already in exchange given the like &amp; better verſes; So that by his great ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and cunning he had as many excuſes as faylers, and a ſalve for every ſore.</p>
               <p>What wilt thou ſay <hi>(O Moore)</hi> unto thoſe verſes in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the firſt book and Chapter, viz: <hi>Oya aynhe alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine, &amp;c.</hi> which in Proſe ſignifies, That God had expreſſely commanded, on penalty, that whoſoever doth the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, incurs great tranſgreſſion and ſin, and what was it? to wit, when a <hi>Moriſh</hi> man or woman are like to dye, they have power to make a Will, and thereby to bequeath a third part of their goods to their parents, brethren, and next kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and in the verſes aforeſaid, he ſayth that this commandement muſt be permanent and juſt amongſt the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and whoſoever ſhall change it, let God's curſe light on him: And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this commandement the <hi>Moores</hi> diſpoſed of their Eſtates for one while during <hi>Muhamed's</hi> life, and if any one

bequeathed a third part of his goods to his parents or brethren, the Will was firme by force of that commandement and verſe; But afterwards there came a crochet into <hi>Muhamed's</hi> head, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any verſe of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he gave a verball command clean contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> he Commanded that they ſhould in no caſe leave a third part of their goods to father mother, ſiſter, nor brother, and according to this laſt ſaying of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> the <hi>Moores</hi> afterwards gave Judgement, and doe judge to this day, and leave the commandement of God and the verſes, as a thing cancelled and annulled; Now tell mee, <hi>O Moore.</hi> Which are thoſe like or better verſes which revoke the verſes aforeſaid? becauſe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in a Chapter of the firſt book ſayes, that God doth not revoke any verſe but to give another like it, or a better, But ſeeing thou haſt no anſwer but Silence, thou muſt know that it is a great tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to leave the commandement of God for the command of <hi>Muhamed;</hi> It were no great wonder if one of God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:169729:41"/>
did revoke another of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; and one of God's verſes revoke another of his verſes, becauſe he that makes a Law, may and hath authority to annull it, as wee find in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God commandeth and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards forbideth, as when he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Abraham</hi> to Sacrifice his ſon <hi>Iſaack</hi> and afterwards would that he ſhould not Sacrifice him, but a Ram, and thelike of the Prophet <hi>Jonas,</hi> Therefore it is a marvelous thing and without reaſon and juſtice that the commandement of God ſhould be revoked and aboliſhed by a ſinfull man, and that they ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what a man ſayes, and leave what God ſayes as voyd and of no force; From whence thou mayeſt know <hi>O Moore,</hi> that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is not the word of God, becauſe that the word of God is as God himſelf, and none can nullifye God or his word. Now then, in regard the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is not the word of God, <hi>Muhamed</hi> hath annulled it and rejected it, for that which God hath layd down for a command of Law, <hi>Muhamed</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:169729:42"/>
that they doe the contrary, not ſhewing any authority from God as he uſed to doe for divers matters and for ſeverall acts which he did, as a little hereafter ſhall appeare; And how can it be authentick, ſeeing <hi>Muhamed</hi> during all the time of the twenty three years (in which he was giving the Law and making the <hi>Alcoran)</hi> alwayes altered the verſes, and commanded them to doe many things by authority of the verſes of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the clean contrary, and to that purpoſe gave authority by other verſes which revoked the former verſes, as appears in the changing of the <hi>Alkibla,</hi> where by the authority of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> he urgeth that they ſhould not pray but in the ſaid houſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> or in the houſe or <hi>Moſque</hi> of <hi>Mecca,</hi> right againſt the tower called <hi>Elcabba,</hi> and for this cauſe it is now called <hi>Alkibla,</hi> (of which <hi>Alkibla</hi> and alteration I ſhall ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Chapter of offences) and thus I ſay that for theſe reaſons <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> never commanded that his <hi>Alcoran</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:169729:42"/>
ſhould be collected or reduced into bookes and Chapters, as now it is, but kept it in the ſaid ſcrowles or papers in the aforeſaid ark or ſhrine, and many of them were loſt and could never be found; ſo that if he had lived a hundred years, he would ſtill have altered his Law, and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> would never have been finiſhed, and therefore he did not reduce it into the form which it now hath; But it was done after he was dead, when <hi>Hozman</hi> his ſon-in-Law was King and <hi>Caliph,</hi> who was the third King after <hi>Muhamed,</hi> for after <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med's</hi> death the aforeſaid <hi>

               <p>This ſaid <hi>Hozman</hi> who collected the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> doth not in thoſe 4. books and 211. Chapters, ſet down all the <hi>Alcoran</hi> which the <hi>Moores</hi> in <hi>Muhamed's</hi> time read in the ſcrowles or papers which the ſaid Secretaries wrote; the which I
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:169729:44"/>
prove by the book <hi>Azar,</hi> and by the book of <hi>Azzifa</hi> which ſay, that in <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed's</hi> time, the 17th. <hi>Chapter of additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> in the third book, was as big as the <hi>Chapter of the Cow,</hi> which is the firſt Chapter of the firſt book, but now it is not above halfe as big as the <hi>Chapter of the Cow,</hi> ſo that there wants halfe the Chapter; And I prove it further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that when the aforeſaid <hi>Hozman</hi> collected the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he found ſeverall papers of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Axa Muhamed's</hi> wife, eaten by mice, out of which he could gather nothing, they having laine behind a cheſt, and being ſpoyled with damp and mice. I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo further prove it by the aforeſaid books, which ſay, that when the ſaid <hi>Hozman</hi> collected the <hi>Alcoran</hi> he went about asking every one what he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> ſome told him that they had forgotten much of it, Others told him that in ſuch a wall he ſhould find ſuch and ſuch verſes in writing, And ſo amongſt the walls and the <hi>Moores</hi> he got part of it, yet nevertheleſſe he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:169729:44"/>
never found the verſe which in <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med's</hi> time commanded that married perſons taken in Adultery ſhould be ſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which verſe was called <hi>Ayate ragime,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>the verſe of Lapidation</hi> which was in the ſixth <hi>Chapter of the Light,</hi> in the third book, ſo that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and had more verſes in the dayes of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> than it now hath.</p>
               <p>Now tell mee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> who never kneweſt or heardeſt ſuch things, what thinkeſt thou of the Scripture which you ſo much reverence, that when ye take it in your hands ye kiſſe it, and ſwear by it, and keep it like a God, and call it <hi>Alkitib Alhazim,</hi> (i. e.) a glorious book and <hi>Alcoran alhadin,</hi> (i. e.) the Mighty <hi>Alcoran,</hi> ſo that indeed ye hould it for a God; I tell thee, <hi>O Moore</hi> that if it were from God and the word of God, that of it which is loſt had not been loſt, and the Mice had not eaten thoſe notes in <hi>Axa's</hi> houſe, &amp; that verſe of <hi>Lapidations</hi> had not been loſt; Obſerve then, <hi>O Moore,</hi> &amp; conſider this, and thou wilt know thy error, &amp; be converted to God, &amp; God will

               <p>Theſe ſix Books of the <hi>Suné</hi> treat of all that <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſpake and did, and commanded to be done, as will appear by the Contents of the following Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in which ſaid ſix Books there are as many Contradictions, fooleries, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, irrationall, and ungrounded things, as there be in the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> ſay that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is the word of God, which is incredible.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth Chapter of this book handleth certain arguments which may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and brought againſt the</hi> Alchoran, <hi>proving that it is falſe of it ſelf, and not the word of God; And alſo againſt</hi> Muhameds Suné, <hi>proving that it is of it ſelf a ridiculous thing, and fit for men of little knowledge and judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe firſt argument is from what is ſaid in the ſecond Chapter of the fourth book, which is in <hi>Arabick Ogna Nofigha, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) that at the end of the world a trumpet or horn ſhall ſound, and the Angels in Heaven, and men on earth, ſhall fall down dead, and afterwards the ſaid trumpet or horn ſhall ſound again, and all aſwell Angels as men ſhall riſe again; wherein the <hi>Alchoran</hi> affirmeth that Angels are mortall, and that they muſt all dye and riſe again, the which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth divine and humane Law, and is againſt all naturall reaſon; and that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:169729:49"/>
for ſeverall cauſes; Firſt, becauſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are ſpirits, having no body, but ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit onely, and not having bodies they cannot dye, for death is nothing but the ſeparation of the ſoul from the body, and in regard men are compos'd of body and ſoul, when the ſoul is ſeparated from the body and departed, the body becomes a Caryon, and the ſoul goes whether God pleaſeth, according to every mans deſerts and works; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the body is compoſed of the four Elements, it corrupteth and turneth to earth; but the ſoul of man after it is crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted never dyes; how then can it be as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſays, that Angels dye, when humane ſouls dye not? The ſecond cauſe is, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin was the occaſion of his death, by which ſinning, all his poſterity were condemned to dye, whence it follows, that if he had not ſinned, neither he nor any of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity had been ſubject to death; Now tell me <hi>O Moore,</hi> what ſins have the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels committed whereby they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved death as <hi>Adam,</hi> who incurred it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:169729:50"/>
by ſin? The third cauſe or ground is a naturall reaſon which gives all men to know and underſtand that Angels dye not, neither can dye, which is this; <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer</hi> and all the Angels that ſinned with him by their pride againſt God, were for this ſin deprived of the glory of Heaven and Paradice, and were caſt into the bottomleſs pit for ever, and were not condemned to dye becauſe they were ſpirits; And if the devils by reaſon of their ſins were not condemned to dye, how is it that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſhall dye? So from theſe three grounds we may conclude that Angels ſhall not dye, and that he that ſays that Angels dye, ſpeaks not the truth, and in regard the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſays that Angels dye, I ſay it is not of God, nor the word of God.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Argument is from what the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes in ſeverall Chapters, and namely in the firſt Chapter of the firſt book, in the firſt Chapter of the ſecond and fourth books, in which three Chapters he relates the Creation of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:169729:50"/>
world, and the hiſtory of <hi>Adam,</hi> how he was created of earth by the hand and Workmanſhip of God, and how God inſpired life into him; and further in the ſaid Chapters, he ſays and affirms, that after <hi>Adam</hi> was created, God Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Angels to bow themſelves down to the ground and worſhip <hi>Adam;</hi> and that they all did ſo, except <hi>Sathan</hi> who refuſed to doe it, and God asked him why hee would not worſhip him whom he had made with his own hands, and he ſays, that <hi>Sathan</hi> anſwered, that he was Created of a more excellent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> Of fire, and <hi>Adam</hi> of durt, then God curſed <hi>Sathan,</hi> and he and all thoſe who had the like will as he, were caſt into the bottomleſs pit and are cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for ever; All this the <hi>Alcoran</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, ſaying that the cauſe of the fall of Sathan and the evill Angels was, becauſe that they would not worſhip <hi>Adam;</hi> nor proſtrate themſelves before him; and the words in <hi>Arabick</hi> are thus, <hi>Ognaidcale,</hi> &amp;c. And doe ſignifie that which we have related and declared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:169729:51"/>
which is not onely an untruth, but alſo a great Hereſy and Blaſphemy; Now ſpeak <hi>O Moore,</hi> and obſerve whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this hath any ſenſe or reaſon in it; for you muſt conceive that if ſuch a thing were true it would have been written in the firſt of the five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is called the book of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> or the Creation; wherein he ſets down the Creation of the world, and how God created all Celeſtiall and Terreſtriall things, but doth not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any ſuch impoſture: and you muſt obſerve, that God would never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that any ſhould be worſhipped but himſelf, ſo that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes that which was never true, and which can never enter into the brains of a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable man; and therefore in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I ſay, that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> hath not any reaſon or truth in it.</p>
               <p>The third Argument is upon the firſt Chapter of the third Book, where hee ſayes, that the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of Jeſus Chriſt, was the Siſter of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſayes in Arabick thus,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:169729:51"/>
                  <hi>Ogia Mariamu ya ohta Aron,</hi> (i. e.) O <hi>Mary,</hi> O Siſter of <hi>Aaron.</hi> Obſerve, <hi>O Moore,</hi> the great error which the <hi>Alcho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> committeth in this place, and how he takes one perſon for another, putting the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> for the Siſter of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was called <hi>Mary</hi> the Propheteſs, and there were above 1500. years between them. Now can we call a Scripture which erres in ſo much time, the Word or Scripture of God? And if it were, as ſome learned <hi>Moores</hi> ſay, that even as God would and Commanded that <hi>Sarah, Abraham's</hi> Wife ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when ſhe was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ninety years old, and was forty years paſt the time of conception; So alſo God had preſerved this <hi>Mary,</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Aaron,</hi> that from her Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour, the Meſſias ſhould come. This reaſon is not good, becauſe in the ſecond Chapter of the firſt Book, he relates the conception of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> the Mother of Jeſus Chriſt, and how ſhe was offered in the Temple for the ſervice of God, and that the Prieſts in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:169729:52"/>
thoſe times caſt lots which of them ſhould have the tuition of her, and the ſaid Chapter ſayes, that the lot fell upon <hi>Zachary,</hi> and that he took charge of her; And in the ſame chapter ſayes further, that this <hi>Mary</hi> had communication with the Angels, and talked with them, and that ſhe was fed and nouriſhed with ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtiall food, which ye may read thus in the <hi>Arabick, Ogna id calati, &amp;c.</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he ſayes in <hi>Arabick, O quullenie da hale, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> That the Angell ſaid to <hi>Mary,</hi> O <hi>Mary,</hi> certainly God hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, adorned, and exalted thee above the women of all generations; and ſayes further, that one day <hi>Zachary</hi> went into <hi>Maries</hi> Oratory (he having the keyes) and there found her eating food which he had not given her, and he ſaid, O <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!</hi> whence hadſt thou this food, ſeeing I have the Keyes of the Oratory, and ſhe anſwered him, that God ſent it her. The Commentators of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> ſay upon this place, that the food which <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> found <hi>Mary</hi> eating, was ripe fruits out of their ſeaſon. This was the ſame
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:169729:52"/>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> to whom the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> came, as appears in the ſame Chapter, which is called in <hi>Arabick, Sorathe alehamran, (i. e.)</hi> a Song of the generation of <hi>Joachim,</hi> the Father of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> I have ſet down this here for the greater demonſtration and proof, that this <hi>Mary</hi> was ſhe unto whom the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel <hi>Gabriel</hi> came with the ſalutation, ſaying; <hi>Hayle</hi> Mary <hi>full of grace, the Lord is with thee, and that conceived Jeſus Chriſt of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> This ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation is in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus, <hi>Oya Marye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mujune, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore <hi>O Moore,</hi> I conclude, that this <hi>Mary</hi> was not the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Aaron,</hi> for the Siſter of <hi>Aaron</hi> was not in the time of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> the Father of St. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> as this <hi>Mary</hi> was; And <hi>Muhamed</hi> was deceived here by the name of <hi>Moſes</hi> father, who in <hi>Arabick</hi> is called <hi>Hembram,</hi> by which name <hi>Joachim</hi> (our Ladye's father) is called in <hi>Arabick.</hi> And thus, <hi>O Moore,</hi> I tell thee, that the reaſon which the <hi>Moores</hi> give of <hi>Maries</hi> being <hi>Aarons</hi> Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is invallid, ſeeing it is proved by the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:169729:53"/>
ſame <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that this <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Jeſus Chriſt lived in the time of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> above 1500. years after the other <hi>Mary;</hi> So that wee muſt ſay, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> take one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for another, and erre in ſo long time; A thing which is not ſutable to a Prophet, nor to the Scripture of God; and therefore I ſay, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> was neither a Prophet, nor the <hi>Alcoran</hi> the Scripture of God; And hence it appears how the Cutlers made him erre, and put one thing for another in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and tranſpoſe the Hiſtories of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets out of due place, putting the firſt laſt, and the laſt firſt, as ſhall hereafter appear; ſo that it hapned to <hi>Muhamed</hi> with his Cutlers, as the Proverb ſayes, When the blind leads the blind, they both fall into the ditch.</p>
               <p>The fourth Argument is from what he ſayes in the third Chapter of the third Book, the words in <hi>Arabick</hi> are, <hi>O qualacad, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> That God ſent the <hi>Alforcan</hi> (which is the ſame with the <hi>Alcoran)</hi> unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:169729:53"/>
Light and admonition to the juſt; If the <hi>Moores</hi> ſay that <hi>Alforcan</hi> doth not ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> I will prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by the ſame <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which in the ſecond Chapter of the firſt Book ſayes, <hi>Onzele athorata y aliugile y nezele al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcane haleique, (i. e.)</hi> God inſpired the <hi>Thora,</hi> the Goſpell, and the <hi>Alforcan</hi> into <hi>Muhamed;</hi> and the ſame is in the ſeventh Chapter of the third Book, in <hi>Arabick, Otabaraque, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> bleſſed be he that cauſed the <hi>Alforcan</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon his ſervant <hi>Muhamed</hi> for to admoniſh the Nations; whence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the <hi>Alcoran</hi> it ſelf, that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcan</hi> imports as much as <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and therefore, <hi>O Moore,</hi> I conclude that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> erre likewiſe in this paſſage, in ſaying that God ſent it to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and wee need not wonder if <hi>Muhamed</hi> lay down this error, ſeeing he ſayes further in the <hi>Suné,</hi> that <hi>David</hi> read all the <hi>Alcoran</hi> whilſt they ſadled his Mule; for hee that ſayes the one may as well ſay the other, and he that makes one girdle, may make a hundred; And
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:169729:54"/>
if thou, ſayeſt, <hi>O Moore,</hi> that by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> is meant the Pſalter of <hi>David,</hi> I ſay, and prove the contrary by the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> it ſelf, which in <hi>Arabick,</hi> ſayes thus, <hi>O qualacad ateyne deude Zabora (i. e.)</hi> God ſent and gave the Pſalter to <hi>David,</hi> hee doth not ſay that he gave him the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> And the ſaid <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> in the <hi>Suné</hi> ſayes, that God ſent the <hi>Thorah</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Goſpel to Jeſus Chriſt the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Pſalter to <hi>David,</hi> and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> to <hi>Muhamed;</hi> And ſo I tell thee that thou haſt no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwer than ſilence. And knoweſt thou not, <hi>O Mooriſh Alfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Chief Prieſt in the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> who canſt ſay the <hi>Alcoran</hi> by rote, that it ſayes in above 300 places, that God gave the five books to <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he calls in <hi>Arabick, Athorata,</hi> and ſaies like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in above as many places, that God gave the Goſpel to Jeſus Chriſt, and the <hi>Azabor (i. e.)</hi> the Pſalter to <hi>David,</hi> and in a thouſand ſuch places he doth not any where ſay that <hi>Alforcan</hi> ſignifies the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thora,</hi> nor that the Pſalter ſignifies the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:169729:54"/>
                  <hi>Alcoran,</hi> therefore conſider this well, and thou wilt ſee and know the truth.</p>
               <p>The fifth Argument is from what is ſaid in the firſt Chapter of the firſt Book, concerning two Angels called <hi>Harod</hi> and <hi>Marod,</hi> who are hanged by the eye-lids in a Cave in the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and are there tormented untill the day of Judgement, the which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth thus in <hi>Arabick, O guame unzile, &amp;c.</hi> ſignifying what hapned to the two Angels called <hi>Harote</hi> and <hi>Marute</hi> in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> The gloſs upon this text ſayes, That God ſent two Angels as Judges to the City of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to doe judgement in that City unto the people, and every night they aſcended into heaven, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended every morning, and ſayes that one day a fair Lady came to them, and complained of her husband, and was ſo acceptable unto them, that they ſolicited her chaſtity; ſhe told them that ſhe was content to grant their deſires, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they would teach her their Praier whereby they aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; They through the great deſire
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169729:55"/>
they had to enjoy her company, taught her the Praier, and when ſhe had it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhe preſently repeated it, and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to heaven; and the Gloſs ſayes, that when the Angels would have aſcended again to heaven they could not, and by reaſon of the ſin which they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they loſt the grace of Praier, and remained on earth; then God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them, that they ſhould chooſe their puniſhment, whether they would ſuffer it in this world, or in the next, and they choſe it in this world, and ſo for that ſin they remain hanging by the eye-lids untill the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The text of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes, that thoſe two Angels taught the men of that place the art of Negromancy, and divers of the <hi>Moores</hi> ſay, that this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man was tranſlated into the Star or light of the morning, (although it be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for authentick, and approved of amongſt the <hi>Moores;)</hi> All this aforeſaid I prove by the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> by the gloſs or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ment on the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and by the <hi>Suné.</hi> Now behold, <hi>O Moore,</hi> who art an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:169729:55"/>
and a Philoſopher, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Hiſtory in thy <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and thou wilt ſee whether there be any reaſon in it; Likewiſe behold thou <hi>Moore,</hi> who art a Divine according to the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Divinitie, which is called in <hi>Arabick Tenbid,</hi> and thou wilt ſee whether it can be conceived by a <hi>Mooriſh</hi> Divine, that the Angels were ever Judges on earth, and whether they have ever known, or can know women; But thou maiſt ſay, that they had ground to ſearch this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. <hi>O Mooriſh</hi> Divine, doſt thou not conceive, that ſuch a thing doth not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Divinitie, nor can a wiſe man believe it, eſpecially a Divine; Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> who daily readeſt the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> how can it conſiſt with the <hi>Alcoran?</hi> Which ſayd, that Angels are Spirits, which is in Arabick <hi>Roch;</hi> for if the Angels are <hi>Roch</hi> and Spirits, as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> makes 'em, then they are not Corporeall, as he ſayes here, and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other places, and as ſhall hereafter further appear.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Argument is upon what is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:169729:56"/>
ſaid in the ninth Chapter of the ſecond book, and the nineteenth Chapter of the third book, and ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>the Chapter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or Empire in the fourth book, where he ſayes, that the Stars lye in the firſt Heaven, that God ſet them there for the beauty and Ornament of the World, and to the end that they ſhould ſtone the devils; and that the ſaid Stars are the keepers of Heaven, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils may not goe into it, and that God ſet them there for this purpoſe; for ye muſt know, that when the devils aſcend towards Heaven, immediatly the Stars goe and encounter them with fiery Darts, as it is in the nineteenth Chapter of the third book, the very words wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus, <hi>O gualacad zeyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That God ſet the Stars in the Heaven for the beautifying of the world, and as a guard againſt all the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed devils, and that a Star with a brand or flame of fire doth interpoſe againſt the devill that would hear the ſecrets; and all this or little leſſe all the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters above quoted doe alleage; And
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:169729:56"/>
hereupon the <hi>Suné</hi> ſays, that the Stars are ſet in the firſt Heaven, bound with chains of gold, and that the greateſt of them is as big as a great mountain, And the <hi>Suné</hi> ſays, that the devils climb up to Heaven and hear divine ſecrets, and then come down hither, and tell thoſe ſecrets to divers men, their familiars. This <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſayes in the book of <hi>Flowers,</hi> and that the Stars which guard Heaven, doe preſently interpoſe and confront the devils with firebrands when they come, and the devils flee from them, and goe away with what ſecrets they have heard and reveale them to divine men. Now ſpeak <hi>O Moore,</hi> who art a wiſe Aſtrologer, Divine, and Philoſopher, whether this can enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brains of a man of any of theſe profeſſions? tell me where is that Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger who grants that the Stars are fixed and bound to the firſt Heaven with golden chains? haſt thou not read the ſayings of Philoſophers, who affirme that the leaſt Star is greater than all the Earth? and for what he ſays that all the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:169729:57"/>
Stars are in the firſt Heaven, knowſt thou not that the Planets are in ſeven Heavens, each having his particular orbe? and knoweſt thou not that the Moon is in the firſt and neareſt to us, <hi>Mercury</hi> in the ſecond, <hi>Venus</hi> in the third, the Sun in the fourth, <hi>Mars</hi> in the fifth, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the ſixth, and <hi>Saturne</hi> in the ſeventh, higheſt of all; Now ſpeak <hi>O Moore,</hi> what thinkeſt thou of this thy Scripture, which ſpeaks ſo many abſurdities; weigh and conſider it well and thou wilt find that it was all dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the aforeſaid Cutlers, and not by God, nor ſent by the Angell of God: The names of the Planets in <hi>Arabick</hi> are theſe.</p>

               <p>I have wrote all this, becauſe that thou <hi>O Moore,</hi> who art a good Aſtrologer, ſhouldſt peruſe thy books of Aſtrology, and what the <hi>Moores</hi> Aſtrologers have written, and ſee whether thou canſt find what the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes, to correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond with their writings and meanings, and ſo thou ſhalt ſee that it is clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and not Conſonant to what they ſay and write of this matter.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Argument is upon what he ſayes in the eighth Chapter of the fourth book, and in the Chapter of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:169729:58"/>
where he ſayes, that a Company of Devils, came one night to hear <hi>Muhamed</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> read the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran;</hi> and in theſe two Chapters hee ſayes, that the Devils took ſuch delight in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that they preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived in <hi>Muhamed</hi> and became <hi>Moores:</hi> And the words of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the Chapter of Devils are thus, <hi>O coluhia, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) O <hi>Muhamed,</hi> tell the <hi>Moores,</hi> that a Company of Devils heard the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and ſaid one to another that they had heard the wonderfull <hi>Alcoran</hi> read, and that they beleived it, and were not miſcriants againſt their Creatour; And the words of the eighth Chapter run thus in <hi>Arabick, O guaid Zarafna, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) And when God ſent thee a Company of Devils that they might hear the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> when they heard it read, they bad each other be ſilent, and after they had heard it read, they all went and admoniſhed their people, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O our people! know ye, that wee have heard a book read which is inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:169729:58"/>
ſince <hi>Moſes,</hi> which book ſhews the right way of Truth, wherefore come yee and obey the Prophet, and beleive in him, and God will pardon your ſins, and deliver you from cruell torments, and whoſoever will not obey the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and beleive in him, ſhall not dwell long on earth, and ſhall have great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; All this is in the <hi>Arabick ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim</hi> as in our tongue, and ye may read it in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the two fore quoted Chapters: Which is not onely againſt reaſon, and againſt divine and humane Law, but is alſo a great hereſy and a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid blaſphemy, being againſt God, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and men, againſt all Scripture, and the very <hi>Alcoran</hi> it ſelf: For tell me <hi>O Moore,</hi> who daily readeſt the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> doth it not direct thee to apply unto God for defence againſt evill and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Devils? and Commandeth thee, that when ever thou takeſt in hand to read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> thou muſt ſay in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick O ahudu billehi mine Saytani ragini,</hi> (i. e.) Preſerve me O God from the wicked and curſed Devill? In divers
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:169729:59"/>
places the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes, that ye muſt reſiſt the Devill, becauſe he is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt enemy of men, and yet here the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes, that they are become the friends of men, God, <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and the Angels: Doeſt thou not conceive that this contradicts the Commandement of God, who curſed the Devill, and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deprived him of his favour; and when he ſayes that God pardoned their ſins who became <hi>Moores,</hi> he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth and oppoſeth the very Angels; For all the good Angels fought againſt the evill Angels, and vanquiſhed them and drove them out of Paradice, and they fell from their ſeats for ever; and yet the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes that the Devils muſt goe into Paradiſe, and be perta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of glory with the Angels, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their firſt Stations; Doth it not appear unto thee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice in God, that the Devils whom he hath for ever rejected ſhould return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into his glory? Behold <hi>O Moore</hi> and conſider this groſſe error which <hi>Muhamed</hi> hath inſerted in his <hi>Alchoran,</hi>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:169729:59"/>
and thou wilt perceive that it is not the word of God, nor a Law given by him.</p>
               <p>The eight Argument is from the eight Chapter of the fifth book, and the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Decoquer at</hi> in the fourth book, where he ſayes, that brutiſh and irrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onall creatures ſhall riſe again at the day of Judgement, and that God ſhall judge between them; this <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſayes in the <hi>Suné;</hi> The words of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> are thus in <hi>Arabick Oguame mindelbetin, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) that all the beaſts of the earth, and all the foules of the ayre ſhall riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the day of Judgement; And in the <hi>Suné</hi> he ſayes, that God ſhall ſo doe juſtice betwixt the creatures, that the beaſt, that hath been gored with ahorne, ſhall have ſatisfaction from the beaſt that gored it; Likewiſe he ſayes in the <hi>Sunê,</hi> that all the ſheepe which the <hi>Moores</hi> kill in their feaſts or Paſſeovers, ſhall riſe at the day of judgement, and pray for the <hi>Moores</hi> who cauſed them to bee ſlain; And ſayes further, that when the Angell St. <hi>Michael</hi> ſhall weigh the good
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:169729:60"/>
and bad works of men, theſe ſheep ſhall come and lye in the ballance of their good works, ſo that the good works of ſuch a man ſhall weigh more than his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill works; And for this reaſon the <hi>Moores</hi> kill many ſheep in their feaſt or paſſeover, although they are not bound to kill above one. Now tell mee <hi>O Moore</hi> who art endowed with reaſon and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, what thinkeſt thou of this afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, is it not an unreaſonable thing and Contrary to all divine and humane Lawes, yea againſt the very <hi>Alcoran</hi> it ſelf? becauſe in the ſecond Chapter of the ſecond book of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> he ſayes theſe words in <hi>Arabick, Oinne Sarra, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) that the worſt beaſts before God are thoſe which are deafe and dumb, which underſtand nothing; as if he ſhould ſay, that bruite beaſts are deaf without underſtanding, and dumb without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgement; And in regard they are without reaſon and judgement, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not lyable to puniſhment in this world for any hurt they doe; for theſe beaſts daily kill other beaſts, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:169729:60"/>
divers men, but a beaſt is not to ſuffer for the death of another beaſt, nor for the death of a man; as wee often ſee a bull bayted kill two or three men, without being puniſhed for it, becauſe that (as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes,) they are deaf without underſtanding, and dumb without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and judgement. How is it then, that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes here, that beaſts ſhall riſe to judgement? If wee ſay that beaſts ſhall riſe to judgement at the laſt day, wee muſt alſo ſay that thoſe beaſts which have done good works ſhall be rewarded and goe into Paradiſe, and thoſe which ſhall have done evill works ſhall be puniſhed in hell; the which <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> ſayes and affirmes in the <hi>Suné,</hi> though the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſay it not; And in the <hi>Suné Muhamed</hi> ſayes, that the ſheep which the <hi>Moores</hi> kill at their Eaſter ſhall goe into Paradiſe. He likewiſe ſayes that the Ram which <hi>Abraham</hi> Sacrificed inſtead of his ſon <hi>Iſaack</hi> was fed forty years in Paradiſe; the which the <hi>Mooriſh Alfaquy's</hi> alſo ſay in their ſermon at the feaſt of the <hi>Adabeyes;</hi> The words in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:169729:61"/>
                  <hi>Arabick</hi> run thus <hi>O faatehu, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) that the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> brought a black ram to <hi>Abraham</hi> which had fed forty years in Paradiſe. Furthermore <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> in the <hi>Suné</hi> ſpeaking to the <hi>Moores</hi> concerning his tranſportation to heaven, ſayes, that <hi>Alborac</hi> would not ſuffer <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> to beſtryde him, except <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> would promiſe him to let him goe into Paradiſe; the <hi>Suné</hi> ſayes, that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> then promiſed <hi>Alborac</hi> that he ſhould be the firſt beaſt that ſhould goe into Paradiſe; whence it appeares <hi>O Moore,</hi> according to what the <hi>Suné</hi> affirmes, that beaſts ſhall goe into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the which is contrary to truth and againſt reaſon; One thing I will ſay <hi>O Moore</hi> in this place concerning the Ram which <hi>Abraham</hi> Sacrificed, which was fed and paſtured forty years in Paradiſe, <hi>viz</hi> that thou ſhouldeſt give me an Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticall account how many thouſand Trickles did that Ram caſt in Paradiſe during thoſe forty years, the which you may find by the rule of multiplication; What thinkeſt thou now <hi>O Moore</hi> of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169729:61"/>
ſuch and ſo great a foolery, and a thing ſo worthy of laughter? In breife all that the <hi>Moores</hi> beleeve and hold is corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reall and terrene, and not ſpirituall; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well in reſpect of this mundane life and converſation, as in reſpect of the glory which wee are to have in the world to come; And in <hi>Muhamed's</hi> Law or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it is not ſufficient to ſay, that men eat and drink in Paradiſe, but he comes to the impudence as to ſay that bruit beaſts goe, eat and drink in Paradiſe; and ſo I conclude, that the Law, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and Scripture, which treateth and ſpeaketh of ſuch things, is not the Law, nor the Prophet, much leſſe the ſcripture of God; for all the premiſes doe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne, Truth, Reaſon, Philoſophy, Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick, Aſtrology, and chiefly Theology, but not that Divinity of the <hi>Moores</hi> which ſpeaks not of ſpirituall things, but of Corporeall and Terrene.</p>

                  <hi>IMprimis,</hi> That hiſtory, which the ninth Chapter of the third book re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of King <hi>Salomon,</hi> of which ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there is no mention in all the Bible, and in <hi>Arabick</hi> it is thus <hi>Oguahoſira, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That King <hi>Salomon</hi> arayed his Armies and Squadrons, aſwell of men as of devills and birds, and that <hi>Salomon</hi> led his Armies unto the river of Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires, then a Piſmire cried out and ſaid to the other Piſmires, O ye Piſmires, goe into your habitations and <hi>Salomon</hi> will not diſtroy you, neither ſhall ye periſh by his Armies; and that <hi>Salomon</hi> woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at the ſaying of this Piſmire and praiſed God; The gloſſe ſayes, that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> heard the voyce of this Piſmire a Leagues diſtance; The Story in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:169729:62"/>
proceeds, and ſayes thus, <hi>Ofata faca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>Salomon</hi> aſſembled the birds, and found that the <hi>Whoop</hi> was wanting, and out of her place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Salomon</hi> threatned the <hi>Whoop</hi> and ſaid, that if ſhe did not give account whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe went, he would torture her and put her to death. The <hi>Arabick</hi> proceeds and ſaies, <hi>Ocalet inni, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) that the <hi>Whoop</hi> anſwered <hi>Salomon</hi> and ſaid, that ſhe knew that which <hi>Salomon</hi> knew not, and ſaid that ſhee had been in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey of <hi>Saba,</hi> where ſhee found the Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> the Lady and Princeſſe of <hi>Saba;</hi> Then <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Whoop,</hi> That he would ſee whether ſhee ſpake a truth or a lye, and <hi>Salomon</hi> ſent a Letter to the Queen of <hi>Saba</hi> by the <hi>Whoop,</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that if ſhee would not obediently come to him, he would come and ruin her countrey; The text of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> proſecuting this hiſtory ſayes thus in <hi>Arabick, Ocale ayuquum, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That <hi>Salomon,</hi> knowing that the Queen of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> was on her way, would have her Royall palace brought thither before
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169729:63"/>
her, that ſhee might ſee his power; whereupon <hi>Salomon</hi> called two devills, and asked them, which of them could ſooneſt bring the Queen of <hi>Sheba's</hi> Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Palace thither before ſhee arived; One of the devills told him, that he would bring it in the twinckling of an eie; the other told him he would bring it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could ſtirr from his ſeat; ſo this devill brought the Palace in an inſtant. When the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> came to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> and found her Royall palace brought thither before her ſelf was come, ſhee marvailed, and ſaid that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's</hi> power was very great. I have inſerted all this aforeſaid into this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for two reaſons; firſt, that all the Readers may know what fables and lies the <hi>Alcoran</hi> treateth of and relateth; ſecondly, to ſhew that <hi>Muhamed</hi> layes down nothing in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> but what the two Cutlers told him, and as they informed him; and for this cauſe the people of <hi>Mecca</hi> ſaid that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was nothing but old ſtories, and in divers places of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> it is ſaid in <hi>Arabick</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:169729:63"/>
                  <hi>Ocalu inhede ille azatero aleguelin,</hi> (i. e.) That the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was nothing but anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtories.</p>
               <p>What the Comment ſayes upon the premiſes is moſt ridiculous, amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things it ſayes, that <hi>Salomon</hi> carried a bed with him three miles in length, and as much in breadth, all wrought of gold and ſilver, which bed was carried by Devils, the riches of the Curtains and Vallens of the ſaid Bed was unexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; And further, that the birds atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this Bed in ſuch an Order, that they flew touching each others wings, and ſerved for a Canopie or ſhadow to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that the Sun might not ſcorch him, And that when the <hi>Whoop</hi> was gone to the ſayd Country of <hi>Saba,</hi> her place was left open, through the which the Sun-beams ſhone and touched <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> face; Whereupon <hi>Salomon</hi> grew angry, and threatned the <hi>Whoope</hi> as is aforeſaid, telling her that he would tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture her, and cut off her head.</p>
               <p>Now ſpeak, <hi>O Moore,</hi> what think you of this Story? Conſider, that it hath no
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:169729:64"/>
reaſon nor any ſemblance of truth in it, nor is it to any purpoſe, or neceſſary to mention or allege ſuch a ſtory, much leſſe of ſuch a man as <hi>Salomon,</hi> and which is not mentioned in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the old and new Teſtaments. Obſerve likewiſe, <hi>O Moore,</hi> the threats and menaces which <hi>Salomon</hi> uſed to the <hi>Whoope,</hi> of torture and death, which thing and ſtory is more like the tales and feigned ſtories which are uſed to little Children, than the ſayings of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet, and a holy Scripture, which the <hi>Moores</hi> ſay the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is; So that I doe hence conclude, that the Scripture which handles ſuch things, is not the Word of God, and the Prophet that ſpeaks ſuch fables, is not a Prophet of God. Likewiſe, <hi>O Moore,</hi> thou oughteſt to conſider, that if the things aforeſayd were true, they would not have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten to have been put into the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament untill they were inſerted in the <hi>Moores Alcoran,</hi> wherefore you may well conceive that this aforeſaid neither is true, nor ever was.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:169729:64"/>
Furthermore, in the fourteenth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the third Book, he brings in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtory of <hi>Salomon,</hi> which is in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> thus; <hi>O ſame dellehum, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> That <hi>Salomons</hi> death was not revealed to the Devils, but only by the worm that eat <hi>Salomon's</hi> ſtaff, whereby <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſell down, and ſo the Devils per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and knew that hee was dead, which till then they knew not; Which ſtory is enlarged thus; That <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> had impriſoned ſeverall Devils, and kept them tormented in Dungeons with chains and fetters of Iron, and when <hi>Salomon</hi> was like to dye, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that his body ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baulmed, and that they ſhould cloath him, as though hee were alive, and ſet him in his royall Throne, to make the Devils believe that he was living; and what <hi>Salomon</hi> thus commanded, was done, and they put a ſtaff into his hand, and fixt it in the ground, that hee might ſit the ſtedier and ſurer in the Chair; and that a worm came out of the earth, and eat thorow the ſtaff, and ſo
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:169729:65"/>
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> fell down, whereby the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils knew that <hi>Salomon</hi> was dead, and ſo they came out of the pains and torments wherein he had put them. All which ſeems to be, and is, a greater fable and lye than the former, though they are both two great Impoſtures, and of little reaſon and judgement.</p>
               <p>Now tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> whether the things aforeſaid are Credible and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be inſerted into the Scriptures of God? to ſay that the Devils had not knowledge of <hi>Salomons</hi> death, when they daily ſaw <hi>Salomon</hi> in his Throne, and ſaw that he neither eat, drank, ſlept, rode on horſe-back, adminiſtred ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, nor did any thing which hee uſed to doe when hee was living; who can believe theſe things to be true? And if they were true, how comes it that they were not recorded amongſt ſo many other things which are written of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi> So that, <hi>O Moore,</hi> you muſt believe that this was all compoſed and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the two Cutlers above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and not by God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:169729:65"/>
Likewiſe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes in the 19th Chapter of the third Book, That God created a Tree in Hell, which tree (as the Comment ſaies) is as big as all Hell, and that the chief of the Devills is the fruit of this tree; which tree is called <hi>Saiara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tazacom;</hi> Of which fruit he ſayes the damned ſhall eat, and ſhall drink boyling lead, and with ſuch drink ſhall fill their bellies; The words are in <hi>Arabick, Oim ſajaratazacom talhohaquaro ozoſayatim.</hi> Of which tree the people of <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Muhamed's</hi> Uncles made a ſcoff, &amp; made verſes on it, and upon occaſion of this tree divers <hi>Moores</hi> fel away and returned to their former opinions, and hereupon this tree in another place of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is called <hi>The curſed tree, viz.</hi> in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter of the ſecond Book, which in <hi>Arabick</hi> ſayes thus, <hi>O guaſſa jarate, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> That <hi>Muhamed</hi> terrified or threatned the peeple of <hi>Mecca</hi> with the curſed tree; The Comment ſayes that it was called accurſed, becauſe it was an occaſion of the loſſe of divers <hi>Moores,</hi> who thereupon became adviſed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:169729:66"/>
to their former Sects.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſpeaks yet a greater fable than theſe, ſaying that God created the Heavens of Smoak, in <hi>Arabick</hi> it ſayes thus, <hi>O cune aztegne, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) that God ſits in the Heavens being of ſmoak, and ſaith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>Suné Muhamed</hi> ſayes that God hath fixed the earth upon the point of an Oxes horn, and ſayes that Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes proceed from this Oxe who bears the earth on the top of his horn.</p>
               <p>Now tell me <hi>O Moore,</hi> who art an Aſtrologer, and haſt read <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> and underſtandeſt the ſphear and the Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labe, and alſo knoweſt how the earth is fixed, and remains firm, for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heavens, What thinkeſt thou of this Oxe who carrys the earth on his horn! for if the earth be fixed on this Oxes horn, on what doth this Oxe ſtand? Conſider <hi>O Moore</hi> this great miſtake and error, which is ſo ignorant and unreaſonable as to affirm that the Heavens are created of ſmoak, and that the earth is fixed on an Oxes horn.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:169729:66"/>
Likewiſe <hi>O Moore</hi> I would have thee conſider whether this Oxe be a bruit beaſt or an Angell; if thou ſayeſt it is a beaſt, then you muſt conſider that the Oxe muſt eat and drink and dye, and if the Oxe dyes then is the earth deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; But if thou ſayeſt that this Oxe is an Angel, it muſt alſo dye, <note n="*" place="margin">According to <hi>Mahomets</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</note> ſeeing Angels dye, and ſo the earth will bee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; And therefore I conclude that all this aforeſaid is a meer vanity, and hath neither reaſon nor truth in it, but are as great fooleries as thoſe of <hi>John de Lenzina;</hi> for it was never aſſerted by any Philoſopher, Aſtrologer, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, or Scripture, that the earth is founded or eſtabliſhed on the horn of an Oxe or Cow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muhamed</hi> further ſayes and relates another thing in the <hi>Suné,</hi> which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Moores</hi> is held for an Article of their faith and Law, <hi>viz.</hi> When any deceaſed perſon is laid in the grave and buried, there come two black Angels to him who are called in <hi>Arabick, Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guir,</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:169729:67"/>
and <hi>Guannequir;</hi> one of which Angels carryes an Iron Mace, and the other certain Iron hooks or Forks; and theſe Angels cauſe the dead perſon to riſe on his knees, and the dead perſon doth put on his ſoul over his body, even as a man puts on a ſhirt; but ſo that here the <hi>Suné</hi> ſayes not, that the dead ſhall riſe again out of the grave, but onely that the body ſhall put on the ſoul; and after that the dead party hath put on his ſoul and is raiſed on his knees, theſe Angels begin to examine him, and aske him whether he believed in <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> and his Law, and whether hee did good works in this world, that is to ſay, whether he made his <hi>Zala</hi> and faſted his <hi>Ramadan,</hi> paid Tyths, and gave Alms; and if the dead render a good account of himſelf, then theſe two black Angels leave him; and there come two other Angels as white as Snow, and one of them ſitteth at his head and the other at his feet, and thus theſe two Angels ſhall acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany the dead perſon untill the day of Judgement;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:169729:67"/>
But if the dead party give an ill account of himſelf, then (ſayes the <hi>Suné)</hi> the Angell that carrys the Mace ſhall ſtrike him ſuch a blow on the head as ſhall run him ſeaven fathome under ground, and the other ſhall preſently faſten his hooks upon him, and drag him under the earth, and he that hath the Mace ſhall continually beat him with great blows, and he that hath the forks ſhall continually drag him untill the day of Judgement; All which the <hi>Moores</hi> hold for authentick and for an Article of their Faith; The words in <hi>Arabick</hi> ſay thus, <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua anne Almu, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That the <hi>Moores</hi> are examined in their Sepulchers, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have done good or evill works, and that God will confirm and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the anſwer of thoſe that believe in him and in <hi>Muhamed,</hi> meaning, that they will anſwer well, and ſhall not have any torments: For which purpoſe and the Angels examination, the <hi>Moores</hi> make their Sepulchers ſpacious, leaving a void place where the dead lyeth, and covering the place with plancks that the
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:169729:68"/>
earth may not fall on the dead party. Likewiſe they leave the cloaths where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the dead is wound up, untyed at the head and feet, that the dead may put forth his head and feet, and raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon his knees when he is exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And alſo the <hi>Moores</hi> put about the dead body, certain names written with Safforn and Oringe-flower water, or wrap them in the winding ſheet, to the end that the dead perſon may be delivered from the pains and torments of the grave and Sepulcher. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the <hi>Moores</hi> have a praier, which they ſay every day after their <hi>Zala</hi> or morning praier; beſeeching God to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver and preſerve them from the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the grave, which praier is in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus, <hi>O allahume negine, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) Deliver me O Lord God from the inquiſition of the two Angels, and from the torments of the grave, and from the evill life; Amen. All this I have here inſerted that the <hi>Moores</hi> may not deny this Article, and that they may alſo ſee the vanity which they hold and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:169729:68"/>
believe in their Law, or Worſhip; For this is a very vain and ridiculous thing, and without any reaſon. Now ſpeak <hi>O Moore,</hi> who art a man of good reaſon and judgement, how is it poſſible that ſuch a ſaying as this can enter into thy head, and that thou ſhouldeſt believe ſo great a mockery and untruth? the which doth contradict the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné</hi> it ſelf; For the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné</hi> in ſeverall places doe ſay, that at the day of judgement every body ſhall receive its ſoul, and men ſhall riſe with ſoul and body, for to give account to God at the laſt judgement; and every one with his body ſhall receive glory or puniſhment; Now then if this be true, how is it that the <hi>Suné</hi> ſays, that men receive glory or puniſhment in the grave? and how can it enter into the brains of a Divine, or of any man of knowledge, that the body ſhould put on the ſoul like a ſhirt? And ſuppoſe it were true, and that the ſoul did cloath the body like a ſhirt, nevertheleſs this body is not a man that can be examined or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:169729:69"/>
tormented, neither is the ſoul of it ſelf, Man, for Man cannot be ſo called but when he is living and compoſed of ſoul and body together: How then can the body anſwer without a ſoul, or the ſoul without a body? and how can the body when it is a Carkaſſe and lump of earth feel the Baſtinado's or blows of a Mace? So that <hi>O Moore,</hi> and Wiſeman (as thou thinkeſt thy ſelf to be) thou haſt no anſwer but ſilence, and to acknowledge that all this is vanity and the words of men ignorant and of ſmall underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>I would alſo <hi>O Moore</hi> that thou ſhouldſt tell me, how will the two white Angels accompany this dead body when it is full of worms, and when it is corrupted and ſtinketh horribly; and what blows can the black Angels give, if the body be all filth, Worms, and Earth? and yet the <hi>Suné</hi> ſayes that they ſhall beat it thus untill the day of judgement<hi>:</hi> So that <hi>O Moore</hi> thou muſt believe that the words of the <hi>Suné</hi> carry no good reaſon with them, as neither doe the words of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:169729:69"/>
thy prophet <hi>Muhamed;</hi> And here I will conclude this fifth Chapter.</p>

               <p>And foraſmuch as the aforeſaid Idol was in the ſaid Temple of <hi>Mecca,</hi> the Jewes again oppoſed the <hi>Moores,</hi> telling and ſhewing them how <hi>Muhamed</hi> made
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:169729:72"/>
them return to Idolatry again, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to pray towards the place where the Idoll was.

And thus the <hi>Moores</hi> began to murmur againſt <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and ſayd that it was not good to pray to the Idoll, and thereupon divers <hi>Moores</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came wary and circumſpect, and turned to their former Sects and waies of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. And when <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſaw the great offence they took, he made the Verſes aforeſaid; and thereupon the <hi>Moores</hi> were ſilent, and were induced to make prayers towards the Temple of <hi>Mecca,</hi> ſaying that God was pleaſed with it, and had commanded it by the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> And this was the <hi>Moores</hi> ſecond offence; And <hi>Muhamed</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> continued thus
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:169729:73"/>
five years, making their prayers towards <hi>Mecca,</hi> whilſt the aforeſaid Idoll was in the temple of <hi>Mecca,</hi> untill <hi>Muhamed</hi> conquered <hi>Mecca,</hi> and deſtroyed the Idoll; and moſt part of the people of <hi>Mecca</hi> were ſlain by the ſword, becauſe they would not become <hi>Moores.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> what thinkeſt thou of theſe five years, during which, <hi>Muhamed</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> made their praiers towards the place where the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll was? Truly to me, and to any one that hath ſence and diſcretion, it ſeems to be a root of Idolatrie, to turn ones face, and to pray towards the Houſe and Tower where the Idoll was. Therefore conſider, <hi>O Moore,</hi> and weigh all the premiſſes and what followes, and thou wilt find that from the beginning of <hi>Muhamed's</hi> Law, untill it was finiſhed, it alwaies proceeded from bad to worſe, was incongruous and offenſive, full of divers confuſions, ſcandalls, and vain fancies, which things give us to know, that it neither was, nor is the Law of God.</p>

                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:169729:73"/>
The third Offence hapned upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of a very ſcandalous and villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Act, and great overſight which <hi>Muhamed</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, <hi>viz.</hi> When he ſayd Mattins with the <hi>Moores,</hi> (which praier is called in <hi>Arabick, Zalatacobbe,)</hi> and was reading a Chapter of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> being the 15th Chapter of the fourth book, which is called the Chapter <hi>of the Starre</hi> (in which Chapter he mentions the ſaid Idol called <hi>Alethe aluze,</hi> and another Idoll called <hi>Menete Azalicite,</hi> and after naming them, ſayes, that they are Idolls and wicked Devils.) For <hi>Muhamed</hi> reading the ſaid Chapter, and naming theſe two Idols, in ſtead of ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were moſt abominable and wicked Devills, ſayd, that they were moſt high Gods, and that it was good to hope in them; And <hi>Muhamed</hi> not onely committed an Error in reading and ſaying theſe words, but alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated himſelf on the ground, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>Moores</hi> with him; but ſome of the <hi>Moores</hi> did not proſtrate themſelves, but told <hi>Mahumed</hi> that he had committed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:169729:74"/>
an error in reading ſo, and proſtrating himſelf; And when <hi>Muhamed</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his error, he anſwered them, ſaying, that the Devill made him miſtake, and had taken away the good words of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and inſerted the words which he had ſpoken, and that through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Devill, hee had erred in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo, and in proſtrating himſelf; The which divers of the <hi>Moores</hi> took notice of, and being offended with it, turned to their former ſects and wayes of worſhip. Thus <hi>Muhamed</hi> was not free from temptations, though hee gave out that the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> took the black coar out of his heart; Wherefore, <hi>O Moore,</hi> you muſt acknowledge that that is not true which <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſaies in the firſt Chapter, That the Angell launced his breaſt, and took forth his heart, and cut out the black coar or filthy matter, to the end that he might not be tempted of the Devill at any time. For if that had been true, the Devill had not now tempted him, nor had made him ſay what he did, nor had he magnified the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:169729:74"/>
Idols, and proſtrated himſelf to the ground to worſhip them; whereof di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers took notice, as we ſaid before. And when <hi>Muhamed</hi> knew that the people were offended, and that all the people of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Jewes</hi> mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured againſt him and his <hi>Moores,</hi> hee inſtituted a Verſe which is written in the fourth Chapter of the third Book, which is in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus; <hi>Guame alcerne, &amp;c.</hi> That God never ſent any Prophet which was not tempted, and when hee read the words of God, the Devill would be buſie and put ſome other words amongſt them. Nevertheleſſe, (ſaies he) God commandeth to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the evill, and confirm the good; and by this Verſe <hi>Muhomed</hi> informed the <hi>Moores</hi> that that had befallen him from the Devill, even as the like had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen other Prophets, and that God commanded that the evill words ſhould be razed out of that Chapter, and good words ſhould be put in, and that they ſhould not marvell at this, much leſſe be offended at it; and ſo upon this Verſe
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:169729:75"/>
the offence ceaſed, and the <hi>Moores</hi> were ſilent; This thing and offence is known but to few of the <hi>Alfaquie's</hi> and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of their Law. And I tell it thee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> that thou mayeſt know it, if thou deſireſt the ſalvation of thy ſoul, and that thou mayeſt acknowledge the truth and follow it.</p>
               <p>There was another thing alſo at which the <hi>Moores</hi> were offended, <hi>viz.</hi> when <hi>Muhamed</hi> took away his ſervant <hi>Zei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din's</hi> wife, whereof we made mention above, which act was very diſhoneſt, villanous, and ſcandalous, eſpecially in ſuch a one as <hi>Muhamed,</hi> who thought himſelf a Prophet, and the moſt perfect meſſenger that ever came into the world; <hi>Muhamed</hi> having at that time nine wives, and his ſervant onely one, the which <hi>Muhamed</hi> took from him, and added to his other nine, and ſo his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant <hi>Zeiden</hi> remained wifeleſſe.</p>
               <p>And this act hapned in this manner; <hi>Muhamed</hi> knowing that his ſervant <hi>Zei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> had a fair wife, and ſhe being <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med's</hi> kinſwoman, one day <hi>Muhamed</hi>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:169729:75"/>
went to <hi>Zeidens</hi> houſe to viſit her, and having ſeen her, told her, that when her husband <hi>Zeiden</hi> came home, ſhee ſhould tell him that the Prophet <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> had been there, and had ſeen a good <note n="*" place="margin">A Lobſter or <hi>Crab,</hi> 'tis an <hi>Arabick</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, as we ſay, He found a dainty diſh for his own Table.</note> 
                  <hi>Crab</hi> for <hi>his</hi> doore; Theſe very words are written in <hi>Arabick</hi> in the book <hi>Azar,</hi> and doe import that <hi>Zeiden</hi> had choſen a good and fair wife for <hi>him.</hi> When <hi>Zeiden</hi> came home, his wife re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated unto him, how <hi>Muhamed</hi> had been there, and had ſaid theſe words unto her, which ſhe could not underſtand. But <hi>Zeiden</hi> preſently told her the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, ſaying that ſhe was the <hi>Crab,</hi> and the Door was a houſe, and ſignified the maſter of the houſe. At laſt <hi>Zeiden</hi> told his wife, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> would have ſpoken with him for no end but to command him to put away his wife, that he might have her. Now tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> what meant <hi>Muhamed</hi> by thoſe words? and whether are they the words of a Prophet and holy man? and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:169729:76"/>
what was his intent? and what opinion had <hi>Zeiden</hi> of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently conjectured and told his wife what <hi>Muhamed</hi> would doe? And when <hi>Zeiden</hi> went to <hi>Mahumed's</hi> houſe, and asked what his pleaſure was, <hi>Mahumed</hi> anſwered him, that he muſt repudiate his wife, becauſe hee would have her himſelf; and hereupon <hi>Zeiden</hi> went home, and related the whole matter to his wife, and after many tears and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations on both ſides, the married couple parted; and the very ſame day <hi>Muhamed</hi> married her. For which act the <hi>Moores</hi> were offended and murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſaying, that it was not the act or deed of a Prophet, nor of a holy man. And although thereupon <hi>Muhamed</hi> was much aſhamed, yet he quickly ran to his remedy, and made and compoſed cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Verſes of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and cauſed his Secretary to write them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently gave them unto the <hi>Moores</hi> to read; the which Verſes are in the 17th Chapter of the third Book, and run thus, <hi>Gua id teculo, &amp;c. (i. e.) O Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed,</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:169729:76"/>
when thou biddeſt thy ſervant <hi>Zeiden</hi> to take his wife again, thou ſayeſt that with thy mouth, which thou mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt not in thy heart, and wouldeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal that which God knows very well, (to wit, the love and affection which he bare to this woman,) and ſo God told him, that ſeeing her husband <hi>Zeiden</hi> had already had his ſhare in her, God had commanded that <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſhould marry her, and that none ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the Prophet for the ſame. The Gloſſers ſay, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> for his greater juſtification, and for fear leſt the <hi>Moores</hi> ſhould be further offended, bade his ſervant <hi>Zeiden</hi> to take his wife again. The Comentators ſay, that God ſaid to him, <hi>Muhamed</hi> through fear of men ſaies one thing with his lips, but concealeth in his heart the love hee bears to this woman. Wherefore I God command, and am content, that thou marry her, ſince her husband hath had his pleaſure of her, and I God doe this, that thou mayeſt not be grieved. The text and gloſſes ſay all this <hi>Verbatim,</hi> which
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:169729:77"/>
is the greateſt cruelty, bawdery, and wickedneſs that two Pandars could plot together, and then to excuſe himſelf from God, and make Verſes, ſaying that God was pleaſed with him, and that God did it to content <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and to ſatisfie his deſire, telling the <hi>Moores</hi> that God was pleaſed at it. All which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which writes it as I ſayd before, and by the book of <hi>Azar,</hi> which relates all this at large.</p>
               <p>Now tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> in what Law or Commandment doe wee read that a Married man ſhould love another mans wife, and ſhould endeavour to take her from her husband? Nay, firſt tell me, how did <hi>Mahumed</hi> underſtand the tenth Commandement which God gave unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in Mount <hi>Sinai?</hi> which ſayes, <hi>Thou ſhalt not covet anothers wife,</hi> which Commandements <hi>Muhamed</hi> in his Law hath commanded to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; And then tell mee thy thoughts upon this inordinate affection which <hi>Muhamed</hi> bore to <hi>Zeiden's</hi> wife, which inordinate affection God himſelf pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:169729:77"/>
in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which ſayes that God knew the love and affection which <hi>Muhamed</hi> bore in his heart to this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, though he concealed it, and for fear of men made ſhew otherwiſe; For thou mayeſt well know that he that doth ſuch things is not, neither can bee a Prophet, nor a meſſenger of God, nor a Legiſlator or Law-giver.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſeventh Chapter treateth of</hi> Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed's <hi>wives and Virgins, and how many profered themſelves to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Contract of mariage, by a ſpeciall Law which he made for himſelf; and of the jarrs, differences, diſſentions and offences, which hapned betwixt</hi> Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>and his wives and ſlaves.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Say and prove by the book of <hi>Azar</hi> that <hi>Muhamed</hi> maried fifteen wives, and had eleven wives to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, beſides ſlaves, and of all his wives had but two Virgins, and had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo four wives who profered themſelves
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:169729:78"/>
to him by vertue of the ſaid ſpeciall Law; And <hi>O Moore</hi> if thou doſt not know that <hi>Muhamed</hi> had nine wives to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I prove it by a book called <hi>Aſſamiel,</hi> which is the book of the good cuſtomes of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> where praiſing <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and ſpeaking of his virill ſtrength, it ſayes, that in one hower <hi>Muhamed</hi> lay with all his wives which were eleaven; The words of the ſaid book <hi>Aſſaniel</hi> are in <hi>Arabick</hi> Thus, <hi>O guamin, &amp;c.</hi> (Which Text might well have been omitted, and better have been ſilent of ſuch things than to publiſh them, for it is unſeemly to make a vertue of vice, and to apply carnall and luxurious things to ſanctity and good cuſtomes, and to ſay that God was pleaſed &amp; ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſuch baſenes as which we have already ſhewn, and ſhall further ſhew in this Chapter,) And I further prove it by the ſaid book <hi>Azar,</hi> and by a book called <hi>Almazhedi,</hi> which ſay, That when <hi>Muhamed</hi> died, his nine wives were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which nine wives continued wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:169729:78"/>
and ſo died, by a ſpeciall Law which <hi>Muhamed</hi> made for himſelf, as ſhall hereafter appear. And the four preſented wives which <hi>Muhamed</hi> had, he got them by a particular and ſpeciall Law, which he made for himſelf.</p>
               <p>For ye muſt know that <hi>Muhamed</hi> made two Laws; one general Law for all the <hi>Moores</hi> and himſelf, and another Law for himſelf in particular; which Law he made in four Caſes.</p>
               <p>The firſt commanded that no <hi>Moore</hi> ſhould take or marry any of his wives, whether repudiated or widdowes, by which Law his ſaid nine wives remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed widdowes and never maried again.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſpeciall Law was for the profered wives, where he commandeth in the 17th. Chapter of the third book, that what wife ſoever would profer her ſelf to the Prophet <hi>Muhamed,</hi> he might take her and bee married to her, without any Contract of marriage, and this was onely permitted to him and not to any other <hi>Moore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third ſpeciall Law was, That
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:169729:79"/>
whereas there was a generall Law and commandement in the 3. Chapter of the firſt book of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that every <hi>Moore</hi> might marry one, two, three, or four wives and no more, <hi>Muhamed</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted himſelf, and had power to marry as many wives as he would, in the 17th. Chapter of the third book.</p>
               <p>The fourth particular Law, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning equality amongſt wives, which the <hi>Moriſh</hi> Laws require of every <hi>Moore</hi> that hath two, three, or four wives, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well at board, goverment, as at bed, and if the husband doe otherwiſe, the wives which find themſelves agreeved, may warn and ſummon him before the judge; Except <hi>Muhamed,</hi> who was not bound to obſerve this Law, neither did it extend to him, as yee may ſee in the 17th. Chapter of the third book, where <hi>Muhamed</hi> terrifying his wives, ſayes, that they ſhould be content with whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Muhamed</hi> would give them, and whenſoever and with whichſoever of them he would pleaſe to bed, take his pleaſure, and depart, and that they ſhould
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:169729:79"/>
be content with every thing, and ſhould not take diſtaſt nor be gerived, but ſhould take delight to doe his will, and rejoyce in all things; The words in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> ſay thus; <hi>Turgimen te ſeu min, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) <hi>O Muhamed,</hi> thou ſhalt love which of thy wives thou wilt, and ſhalt diſmiſs to turn away which thou pleaſeſt, with ſuch condition that they ſhall be content with all things, and ſhall be quiet, and not ſorrowfull at all for thy doings; The <hi>Moores</hi> read all this text, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it not, for did they underſtand it, they would not continue <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Muſſelmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſpeak <hi>O Moore,</hi> thou reader of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> how often haſt thou read this and delighted thy ſelf with the ſweet ſound of the words, and haſt not thought or conceived what the words mean, therefore hence forth obſerve and read, and conſider what thou readeſt, and thou wilt find many things without reaſon and juſtice; And thus you muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that this fourth ſpeciall Law, and the Verſes aforeſaid were made, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:169729:80"/>
of certain Gentlewomen <hi>Muhameds</hi> repudiated Wives, who were not ſo well governed as the reſt, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to <hi>Muhamed,</hi> entreating him to regard God and his Conſcience, and to make them equall to his other Wives, and ſeeing they alſo were his Wives, that they might not be neglected: unto whom he anſwered with the verſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, ſaying, That God would have it ſo, and that for his part he was not to follow the <hi>Moores</hi> in the matter of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality; And they having underſtood and heard the verſes; and that God had ſent them to him becauſe of them, they were content to take all things patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But nevertheleſs they all ſaid, that God loved <hi>Muhamed</hi> exceedingly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee alwaies ſent him Verſes and Chapters for every purpoſe, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own deſires.</p>
               <p>And this appears to be true, by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther moſt ſhamefull and ſcandalous Act which <hi>Muhamed</hi> did, upon which he compoſed almoſt a whole Chapter for to ſatisfy his deſires and to repair
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:169729:80"/>
his honour, giving out that God ſent this Chapter to him and the <hi>Moores,</hi> for to give them a new generall Law; which Law much pleaſed the <hi>Moores</hi> then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, thoſe which followed, and thoſe now living, as will here under appear.</p>
               <p>For yee muſt know, that a certain King of the <hi>Jacobites</hi> called <hi>Baheira</hi> preſented to <hi>Muhamed</hi> a very beautifull maiden, being a Jeweſſe, called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine,</hi> of 15. years of age, with whom <hi>Muhamed</hi> fell in love and ſought op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to lye with her, which at laſt he did; with this Laſſe was <hi>Muhamed</hi> taken and ſurpriſed by two of his wives whom he beſt loved, and were the moſt noble and principall of them all; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one was called <hi>Axa</hi> the daughter of <hi>Ubequar,</hi> and the other was called <hi>Hafeza</hi> the daughter of <hi>Homar;</hi> And being thus by them ſurprized with the ſaid young girle, they reproved <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> telling him that he had done a thing unworthy a Prophet or a married man, and had committed Adultery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all his Wives, whereupon <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:169729:81"/>
ſought reconciliation, and told them, that if they would keep it ſecret, he would ſwear to them by God, never to doe the like with the ſaid <hi>Marine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and ſo they were perſwaded to keep the thing ſecret; but nevertheleſs (like diſcreet Women) they told him, that if he came again to the ſaid <hi>Marine,</hi> it ſhould be lawfull for them to repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate him, and be divorced from him; So that what <hi>Muhamed</hi> had done, did hereupon remain ſecret certain dayes; but nevertheleſs the affection and love which <hi>Muhamed</hi> bore to this young Laſſe, and the jealouſy and diligence of his two wives was ſo great, that at laſt they took him again with the young Wench, and hereupon being much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, they went to their Fathers hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as repudiated Wives; upon which occaſion the ſecret was publiſhed, and <hi>Muhamed</hi> diſgraced, and the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much offended, murmured and ſpake a thouſand blaſphemies, whereupon <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> was much caſt down &amp; confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, aſwell for the diſgrace and divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:169729:81"/>
of the ſecret, as for his two Wives, who were the moſt dearly valued and nobleſt that he had; and for theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>Muhamed</hi> was quite daſht out of countenance, but being a very ſubtile and crafty man, he had preſently recourſe to the remedy of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> unto which he compoſed a Chapter, and made a new Law for all the <hi>Moores,</hi> that they might lye with their ſlaves with as much freedom as with their Wives, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that their Wives were angry and repined at it, as his Wives had done; the which Law he put in the beginning of the Chapter, thereby to gain the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of all the <hi>Moores;</hi> and in the ſaid Chapter is ſet down how <hi>Muhamed</hi> was excuſed, and did not ſin, and that his Wives ought not to publiſh any thing which he did in ſecret, and that God warned his Wives to return to him; and thus <hi>Muhamed</hi> cleared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and repayred his credit, and got his two Wives again, who were thereupon ſatisfied and became conformable, and returned very penitent to <hi>Muhamed.</hi>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:169729:82"/>
And ſo <hi>Muhamed</hi> lay with his ſlave the young Girl by authority of the Law which he inſerted in the ſaid Chapter; Whereupon all his Wives ſaid, that he did whatſoever he pleaſed, like God, and that God ſent him Chapters and verſes purpoſely to ſatisfy his will. The Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which <hi>Muhamed</hi> made and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the aforeſaid occaſion, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Chapter <hi>of Prohibition</hi> in the fourth book, and ſayes in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus, <hi>Oya ayue, &amp;c.</hi> Which ſignifies: O Prophet, becauſe that to content thy Wives thou wilt prohibit what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for thee, therefore know, that God permitteth you <hi>Moores,</hi> freedom to lye with your ſlaves, which was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the beginning; And ſo the Chapter proceeds, and ſayes, thus And when the Prophet committeth a ſecret to any of his Wives which they publiſh, if yee Wives will repent before God, good will betide you, but if yee will remain repudiated from <hi>Muhamed,</hi> his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor will give him other Wives, <hi>Moores,</hi> believers, devout Virgins and Widows.
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:169729:82"/>
All this the ſaid Chapter contains <hi>verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim.</hi> So that when <hi>Muhamed</hi> had cauſed the Chapter to be written by his Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in a table-book or ſcrowl, he made him to read it to the <hi>Moores,</hi> and when the <hi>Moores</hi> heard it and read it, they were much pleaſed with ſuch a Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might lye with their ſlaves; and upon the giving of this Law and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were reconciled to him, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured him ſo much that they all went and exclaimed againſt his Wives, and told them that God threatned them if they would not return to him; Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that their Parents went to <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> to entreate him to receive them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, becauſe they deſired no man but himſelf; And ſo with this Law and Chapter all things were in peace.</p>
               <p>Now ſpeak, <hi>O Moore,</hi> and conſider that <hi>Muhamed</hi> is not blameleſs in his actions although the ſaid Chapter doe much favour him; For although in this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he permits the <hi>Moores</hi> to lye with their ſlaves, yet it doth not follow but that <hi>Muhamed</hi> committed Adultery,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:169729:83"/>
Becauſe the Chapter was publiſhed, and the Law given to the <hi>Moores</hi> after <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> had known the ſlave, and had been twice taken with her; And beſides that Chapter doth not acquit <hi>Muhamed</hi> from the guilt of perjury; becauſe he ſware and engaged his faith to his Wives, that he would never touch the ſaid young Wench again; So that although the Chapter doe favour <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> were pleaſed with the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the looſe liberty which they got thereby, nevertheleſs, <hi>O Moore,</hi> thou muſt confeſs, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> is guilty of ſuch things as doe not become a holy man, much leſs a perſon ſo high and excellent as ye make <hi>Muhamed,</hi> yea the moſt holy, moſt perfect, and moſt choice creature that God ever created, as he calls himſelf, and as ye ſay in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick, O</hi> Muhamed <hi>hayri halquilleh</hi> (i. e.) That <hi>Muhamed</hi> is the moſt choſen man of God; and if you give him ſo high a title, and he himſelf aſſumes it, and is ſo called, it had been very reaſonable and juſt, that he ſhould have been the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:169729:83"/>
chaſteſt, honeſteſt, and trueſt man in the world; for a mans conditions ſhould agree with the title and dignity of the man. Finally, <hi>O Moore,</hi> I deſire thee to obſerve and conſider hitherto, what works and actions the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné</hi> are full of, and compare them with the works and deeds which the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts of Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour hold forth, and thou ſhalt ſee, how the deeds and works of our Saviour agree with his dignity and his holy names, who is called in the <hi>Alcoran, Hice Almaceh que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limetu allah guaroh allah</hi> (i. e.) Jeſus the Chriſt, the word of God, and the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; of which three names no man in the world but he was ever wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, being divine names; and ſuch as were the names and the dignity of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch were his life, his words, his works, and his Counſels. And likewiſe thou wilt find the Evangeliſts ſo full of ſuch great and manifeſt miracles, and pious works which Jeſus Chriſt did in his life, and of ſo good and holy Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which his Diſciples taught after
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:169729:84"/>
him, that there cannot poſſibly be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; And <hi>O Moore,</hi> by making this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, thou wilt ſee what difference there is between <hi>Muhamed</hi> and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer Jeſus Chriſt, and the Scriptures of either, and ſo thou wilt come to know the truth.</p>

Then ſaid <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> Now tell me, what means that great Cock; the Angell anſwered, When this Cock croweth, all the Cocks here of his ſhape crow preſently, and when the Cocks on earth hear the Cocks of heaven crow, then they crow alſo; and whilſt <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſtood wondring at it, this great Cock began to crow, and all the Cocks in heaven crowed with him, and preſently afterwards all the Cocks on earth crowed alſo. The ſaid book ſayes, That from this place they aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169729:87"/>
to the ſecond heaven, which was made of beaten gold, and knockt at the gate, and the Porter asking who was there, the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> anſwered, it is I, and <hi>Muhamed</hi> the friend of God is here with me, and as ſoon as he had na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Muhamed,</hi> preſently the gates of that heaven opened of themſelves, and they went in and ſaw upon all the gates of that heaven the name of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten together with the name of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> which is in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus; <hi>Ole ilehe ille allah Muhemed razolo allah, (i. e.)</hi> This God is the onely God, and <hi>Muhamed</hi> is the Meſſenger of God; It ſayes that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in at the gate of this ſecond hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they found <hi>Noah,</hi> a very old gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed man, <hi>Muhamed</hi> embraced him, and <hi>Noah</hi> was very glad to ſee <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and to ſpeak with him, and <hi>Noah</hi> made application to him, and entreated him to remember him when he came to God. Hee ſayes, that in this ſecond heaven, they found a great multitude of Angels, half as many more as were in the firſt heaven, and of very wonderfull and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169729:88"/>
great ſhapes, amongſt which was one Angell who ſtood on the ſecond hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and his head reached to the third, and one of his hands to the Eaſt, and the other unto the Weſt end of heaven, and many other wonderfull things they ſaw here.</p>
               <p>And from this heaven they aſcended to the third heaven, which was made of a pretious Stone, and there they met with <hi>Abraham,</hi> being an old hoary man, and the Angels in this heaven were far more in number than thoſe of the two other heavens, and much greater, and amongſt them they ſaw an Angell who from one eye to the other had the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of 70000. dayes-journey; Which Angell held a book in his hand, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did any thing elſe but look on the ſaid book, and expunge what was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in written, and write anew therein. <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> asked the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> who this Angell was, and what it was he read in that book, and what he wrote and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punged. The Angell anſwered and told him, that this Angell was called in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:169729:88"/>
                  <hi>Malach almenti, (i. e.)</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of the dead; And the book which he had in his hand was the book called in <hi>Arabick, Alhaunhe ahnafod, (i. e.)</hi> the preſerved book, wherein are the names of all men that are born, and the Angell noteth and calculateth the years and dayes that every one muſt live, and when any mans dayes are expired, hee expunges ſuch a mans name, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the man dies on earth. Likewiſe he writes down the names of all men that are born, and the dayes of their life, and how long they ſhall live, ſo that this Angell hath no other office, but to put in and expunge out of this book. He ſayes that from thence they went to the fourth heaven, which was made of a very pure Emerauld, in which heaven they found <hi>Joſeph</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who greeted <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and made great application to him, and there they ſaw many more Angels than were in the other heavens, and of far greater bodyes; amongſt which there was one great Angell which made great lamentation, <hi>Muhamed</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169729:89"/>
the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> wherefore this Angell lamented ſo; and <hi>Gabriel</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, that that angell lamented the ſins of men, and thoſe which went to hell.</p>
               <p>From thence they went to the fifth heaven, which was made of a Diamond, where <hi>Moſes</hi> was, who made application to <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and in this heaven were as many Angels as in the other, but farre greater; And ſo they aſcended to the ſixth heaven, where was <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> who ſaluted <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, they ſaw a multitude of Angells far greater than any of the former, and this heaven was made of a Carbuncle.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh heaven they met with Jeſus Chriſt, unto whom <hi>Muhamed</hi> made application, and this heaven was made of the Light of God, and here they ſaw many more Angels than in the other ſix heavens, and far greater, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which was one that had ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thouſand heads, and every head had ſeven hundred thouſand tongues, and each of theſe tongues had ſeven hundred
<pb facs="tcp:169729:89"/>
thouſand voyces, with all which voyces or languages they praiſed God day and night. Likewiſe amongſt theſe Angels were divers which alwayes watched without ever ſhutting their eies, others alwayes bowed their heads without ever erecting themſelves, others lay alwayes proſtrate and never aroſe, and others praiſed God with ſuch loud voyces that they put their fingers into their ears, leſt they ſhould become deaf with the noiſe of their voyces; In this ſeventh heaven the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> took his leave of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and told him that he might not goe further, and that now God would guide him himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſaies, that he began to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend certain ſublimities and hights, and through ſo much rain and ſnow, that hee became ſo wearied and tyred, that hee could goe no farther, and at that inſtant <hi>Muhamed</hi> heard a voyce, ſaying in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> thus, <hi>Oya</hi> Muhamed, <hi>anden guali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabach cellem. (i. e.)</hi> O <hi>Muhamed,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and ſalute thy Creator. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Muhamed</hi> drew neer to the voyce,
<pb facs="tcp:169729:90"/>
and ſaw ſo great a light, that it troubled his ſight; He ſayes, that God had on his glorious face ſeventy thouſand vayles of Devine light, and the Text of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the third book ſayes, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> approached God within two bowe-ſhots, or little leſſe; In <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> it is thus, <hi>O zumen, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> That <hi>Muhamed</hi> approached God within little leſs than two ſhots of a Croſs-bow; <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſayes further, that ſo great a light proceeded from the vayles which God had on his face, that hee could not behold the viſage of God; Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſayes that God interpos'd his hand for a ſhadow unto <hi>Muhamed,</hi> but he could not endure it, by reaſon of the great cold which proceeded from it. He ſaies, that in this place God ſpake to him, and gave him divers Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Law, and told him many ſecrets; and yee muſt know, that if I ſhould write all the things which <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſayes hee ſaw that night, a ream of paper would not contain them. <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſayd, (as the book <hi>Azar</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:169729:90"/>
that this night God granted five things unto him, which were never giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to any Man before nor ſince.</p>
               <p>The firſt was, that he ſhould be the chiefeſt and moſt elect creature that God ever created either in heaven or on earth, which the <hi>Arabick</hi> calls <hi>Hayriall quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond was, That he ſhould be the moſt excellent and moſt Honourable. Lord of all the ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> at the day of judgement, the <hi>Arabick</hi> ſays thus, <hi>leydo qualidiademe y aume alquima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third was. That he ſhould be the generall Redeemer, which in <hi>Arabick</hi> is ſaid <hi>Safey Muſtafa,</hi> and for this cauſe <hi>Muhamed</hi> is by another name called <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebi</hi> (i. e.) he that takes away ſins.</p>
               <p>The fourth was, That he ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand all languages, In <hi>Arabick</hi> it is expreſt thus, <hi>Ohtito jagua ni ih alque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fifth and laſt was, that ſpoyles of warre and battaills ſhould belong to him only, which is in <hi>Arabick, Ohillet, &amp;c. Muhamed</hi> ſaies that God gave him all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:169729:91"/>
theſe things that night, whereat divers <hi>Moores</hi> were offended, and ſaid that it was all fictions and lies, &amp; that he never went up to heaven nor ſpake with God; And to the end that the <hi>Moores</hi> ſhould beleeve all that he ſaid, he made certaine verſes in the Chapter of the ſtars in the fourth book, which in <hi>Arabick</hi> run thus; <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guaneginni &amp;c.</hi> which in Proſe are, That God ſwears by the Starrs, that he will not ſuffer your freind to be tempted, nor to ſpeak untruth, nor to ſpeak vainly, and that it was all a true revelation which Almighty God had ſhewn unto him, and that he had approached God within two bow-ſhots or thereabouts, And that God had revealed to his ſervant <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> what was revealed to him, and that <hi>Muhamed's</hi> heart lied not, and that <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> that night ſaw the great wonders of God, and that God ſhewed him a very high throne in the divine Empire, where is the Paradiſe of God. All this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation is drawn <hi>Verbatim</hi> from the <hi>Arabick</hi> in the Chapter aforeſaid, So that when the <hi>Moores</hi> read theſe verſes
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:169729:91"/>
they beleeved, and held it for a great Miracle, though divers of them were offended and returned to their former Sects.</p>
               <p>In the eleventh Chapter of the ſecond book he ſayes, <hi>Oguama, &amp;c.</hi> That God put this Viſion for a great offence to men, that is, in reſpect of their dammage who were offended; the book of <hi>Azar</hi> ſayes, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> took leave of his Creator, &amp; turned back to goe down by the ſame way he went up, and returning to the ſeaventh heaven he told the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell <hi>Gabriel</hi> all that had paſſed between him and his Creator, And the Angell ſaid to him, <hi>O Muhamed,</hi> God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me that I ſhould lead thee to ſee Paradiſe and the ſecrets there, and afterwards we will goe to Hell, and thou ſhalt ſee the ſecrets of Hell, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are there, and how they are tormented of the devill; and hereupon they went firſt to Paradiſe, and ſaw it's riches, excellencies and beatitudes; and the chaſt Virgins and youths, and the rivers of water, of milk, of honey, and
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:169729:92"/>
of wine, which are in Paradiſe; and the fountains, and their names, the Palaces, trees and gardens; All which you ſhall ſee deſcribed at large in the enſuing ninth Chapter, which is the Chapter of Paradiſe, from whence they went to hell, and ſaw that hell had ſeven gates, and ſaw an infinite of Devills of divers kinds and figures, ſome fetterd with chaines of fire, others with ginnes and boults; and divers men ſitting at tables who had good meat ſet before them, and amongſt the good food alſo much bad and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, and they left the good food and eat the bad, whereupon <hi>Muhamed</hi> asked the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> what men thoſe were, and he told him that they were the maried men of this world, who left their own good wives and went to other mens. And he ſayes that they ſaw divers men who never did any thing elſe but drink boyling lead and fill their bellies with it, and afterwards their bellies opened and all that they had drank ran out, and then they drank again, and did thus perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; And <hi>Muhamed</hi> asked the Angell
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:169729:92"/>
what kind of men thoſe were, and he anſwered that they were thoſe who eat and devoured Orphants eſtates in this world; in brief he ſayes he ſaw divers other things, which would be too long to rehearſe. Now hearken. <hi>O Moore,</hi> and conſider all that I ſhall ſay upon this viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and give ear to three things which I ſhall tell thee, and give what anſwer to them thou canſt, The firſt is a naturall reaſon, which cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood but by reaſon and good judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, The ſecond is a Philoſophicall and Aſtrologicall reaſon, which cannot be underſtood but by Aſtrology and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, The third containes a humane and logicall reaſon, for humane and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall reaſon is that which ſeparateth truth from falſhood. Now for the firſt which is held forth by naturall reaſon, it is from what <hi>Muhamed</hi> in this viſion ſayes, that the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> brought him a beaſt called <hi>Alborac,</hi> on which <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſhould have rid, but ſhe would not yeald to it untill <hi>Muhamed</hi> had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that ſhee ſhould be the firſt beaſt
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:169729:93"/>
which ſhould goe into Paradiſe; upon this, I ask thee <hi>O Moore,</hi> what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is there, that a bruit beaſt ſhould or can goe into Paradiſe? yea (as he ſays,) that this <hi>Alborac</hi> ſhall be the firſt beaſt that ſhall goe into Paradiſe, for it he be the firſt, it followes that there muſt be a ſecond and a third; Now, how can it enter into the brains of a man endued with naturall reaſon to beleeve that bruit beaſts ſhall goe into Paradiſe? beſides, in the ſix books of the <hi>Suné Muhamed</hi> ſays, that the Ram which <hi>Abraham</hi> kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led was fed forty years in Paradiſe, and ſays further, that the ſheep which the <hi>Moores</hi> kill at their Eaſter ſhall goe into Paradiſe, ſo that <hi>O Moore,</hi> thou canſt not avoyd nor contradict any thing of this above which affirmes that beaſts en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and goe into Paradiſe, conſider this therefore <hi>O Moore</hi> with thy naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and thou wilt ſee that it is ridiculous, an impudent lie, and utterly falſe.</p>
               <p>Concerning which beaſt <hi>Alborac,</hi> I doe further aske thee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> who art an <hi>Alfaquy</hi> and a learned man, and who
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:169729:93"/>
haſt read all the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the commentaries thereon, <hi>viz. Buhatia, Buzamanim, Azamahxari, Acahali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi</hi> and <hi>Mahuma Miquite,</hi> and who haſt alſo read the ſix books of the <hi>Suné,</hi> and the <hi>Recele, Bulugis, Halil,</hi> and <hi>Almazhodi,</hi> and who haſt likewiſe read ſeaven hundred volumnes which the <hi>Moores</hi> have in their Laws and Sect, if peradventure thou haſt found any text, gloſs, or paraphraſe, which men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this <hi>Alborac,</hi> or from whence he came, or whether he went; whether he was from heaven or from earth, or of what race of beaſts he was, or what became of him after that <hi>Muhamed</hi> came from Heaven to the gate of the Temple; and ſo thou wilt ſay that there is not, nor hath been any mention made of him in all the writings of the <hi>Moores,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ought to have been had in remembrance; eſpecially being a beaſt which had ſo much privilege as to be the firſt that ſhould goe into Paradiſe; Now what wilt thou anſwer me, <hi>O Moore</hi> to this and to what I ſhall ſay further
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:169729:94"/>
concerning this beaſt, which is, That the <hi>Moores</hi> ſay and believe, and find in the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné,</hi> that thoſe which goe into Paradiſe are <hi>Mazhodin guerammum, bararat,</hi> (i. e.) That they are holy, bleſſed, honoured, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall; So that if this <hi>Alborac</hi> be gone into Paradiſe, wee muſt ſay that he is bleſſed, honoured, and Angelicall; And thus, <hi>O Moore,</hi> thou haſt no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this firſt concluſion but ſilence.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, I aske thee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> who art a Philoſopher and an Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, where doth it appear to be true that the firſt Heaven is of Silver, the ſecond of Gold, the third of a Pearl or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone, the fourth of an Emerauld, the fifth of a Diamond, the ſixth of a Carbuncle, though he ſaies the the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth is of Light; knoweſt thou not, <hi>O Moore,</hi> that Gold, Silver, Pearl, and the other following ſtones are obſcure bodies, which our ſight cannot pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, becauſe they are opacous and not tranſparent, and knoweſt thou not that we ſee the Planet <hi>Mercury,</hi> which is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:169729:94"/>
Lodged in the ſecond Heaven; and doe likewiſe ſee the Planet <hi>Venus</hi> which is in the third Heaven, and we ſee the Sun which gives light to all the world, and is in the fourth Heaven; wee ſee <hi>Mars</hi> in the fifth, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the ſixth, and <hi>Saturn</hi> in the ſeaventh Heaven? in brief, we alſo ſee the Stars which are in the eighth Heaven, which Planets wee often cannot ſee becauſe of ſome little cloud which interpoſeth between them and our ſight, and the Moon often Eclipſeth and covereth the <hi>Suné,</hi> It is manifeſt that in the courſe of the Moon, at certain times in the year, ſhe interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, Eclipſeth, and hides the Sun from our eys, becauſe the Moon is an obſcure body, although the Sun and the Stars be light bodies, ſo that if the firſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the ſecond, the third, and the reſt were metalline, as <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſayes, how could we ſee the ſaid Planets and Stars? and now, <hi>O Moore,</hi> what anſwer haſt thou but ſilence.</p>
               <p>And concerning the third, I intend it for the five things which <hi>Muhamed</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:169729:95"/>
ſayes God gave him that night, which he never gave before to any Prophet; Conſider, <hi>O Moore,</hi> if they are not things which cannot be proved either by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man underſtanding or Logicall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? for human and Logicall reaſon commandeth and teacheth that a man ſhould ſay nothing but what can be proved. Now tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> how can it be proved that <hi>Muhamed</hi> was the moſt excellent creature that God ever created in Heaven or on Earth? Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe how can it be proved that he ſhall be Lord over all men at the day of judgement, or that he ſhall be the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Redeemer at the day of judgement? which things are hidden, and unknown to all the world, neither doth his own word give any proof; And therefore I ſay, That what cannot be proved by it ſelf, nor by reaſon, ſhould not be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor ought to be regarded. <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> ſhould at leaſt that night have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of God ſome ſpeciall ſign, as he gave to <hi>Moſes,</hi> to <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Salomon,</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt, and to the Apoſtles after
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:169729:95"/>
them, which ſigns and miracles they wrought in the preſence of the people; But <hi>Muhamed</hi> was very crafty &amp; ſubtile to ſpeak of things which the people nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw nor could ſee, and thus he ſets down all the miracles which the <hi>Moores</hi> read of him, none of them were done in the preſence of any <hi>Moore,</hi> but himſelf ſaies that he did ſuch and ſuch a thing, and that ſuch a thing befell ſuch a one, and ſuch a miracle was already done, but never mentions in whoſe preſence he wrought them; And ſo alſo he repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and compoſed this myſtery of the Viſion, but he doth not bring in the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of any that ſaw him when he went up the Ladder, nor when he got upon <hi>Alborac,</hi> nor when he made the <hi>Zala</hi> or praier on behalf of the Prophets who were already all <hi>Moores,</hi> it had at leaſt been reaſonable that ſome man then living, had been in the Temple at the <hi>Zala</hi> for to have been witneſs of ſuch things; So that, <hi>O Moore,</hi> I tell thee, that upon conſideration of all theſe things, thou mayeſt of thy ſelf know,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:169729:96"/>
that it is all falſe, and nothing of it true; and becauſe I will not be too tedious, I will not lay down the Arguments which might be made upon every thing which <hi>Muhamed</hi> mentions in this viſion, but I will conclude as concerning the ſayd Viſion.</p>

                  <hi>Muhamed</hi> in the <hi>Suné</hi> ſaith, that if any one of theſe Virgins ſhould appear at midnight, ſhe would enlighten all the world like the noon-day, and if ſhe ſhould ſpit in the Sea, the water of the Sea would become as ſweet as hony; and theſe Virgins are prepared in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe for men; and further the ſaid Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters mention their Carkanets, Rings, Trinkets, Coronets, &amp; other Ornaments which are prepared in Paradiſe; and that theſe Virgins are not of humane race, but are continually created.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould goe about to ſet down all thoſe things which the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné</hi> doe write of Paradiſe, I ſhould be too tedious and troubleſome, therefore I will onely ſet down that which <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> in the <hi>Suné</hi> reports concerning the feaſt which God will make to the men and women in Paradiſe, which feaſt is called in <hi>Arabick, Hadrate Alcoduz;</hi> God makes this feaſt in the Paradiſe called <hi>Genetu Alcoduz, (i. e.)</hi> the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of the holy; and <hi>Muhamed</hi> in the <hi>Suné</hi> ſayes, that after a time he will by

vertue of his generall Redemption, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe the <hi>Moores</hi> who have deſerved hell fire; And that theſe <hi>Moores</hi> ſhall come out of hell black and burnt, and he will bring them to his Fountain <hi>Alcau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and cauſe them to goe into the Fountain, and there they ſhall waſh their bodyes, and ſhall become as white as ſnow; and when they are waſhed and purified, <hi>Muhamed</hi> will take them with him, and bring them into Paradiſe unto the other <hi>Moores,</hi> who have not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hell.</p>
               <p>After this, hee ſaith that God ſhall command the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> to take the Key of <hi>the Paradiſe of the holy,</hi> for to make this feaſt, which Keyes are kept by another Angell, and that when <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſhall goe to fetch the Keyes, and ſhall demand them of the Angell that keeps them, the ſayd Angell ſhall put his hand to his mouth, and ſhall draw forth thence ſeventy thouſand keyes, each of which hath (a place of) 70000. leagues in length (which make together 2000000 leagues over,) And when the Angell

                  <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſhall goe to take up the keyes, he ſhall not be able to lift them, becauſe of their great weight, and hereupon hee ſhall return to God, and ſay, Lord, I cannot lift the keyes from the gound becauſe of their great weight, and God ſhall ſay unto him, goe again, and call upon my holy name, and the name of my friend <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and then take the keyes, and bring them hither. Then <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> ſhall goe again and call upon thoſe names, and ſhall take up the keyes, and bring them to God.

in that Act of embracing each other the ſpace of fifty years, without riſing or ſeparating from each others body, taking all manner of pleaſure that a man can have with a woman. And after they ſhall have thus taken their pleaſure, God ſhall ſay, O my ſervants, now yee have eaten and drank, and are clothed, dreſſed, and adorned with Jewels, and have taken your pleaſure in my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe and glory, I will now ſhew you my glorious face; hee ſayes that God ſhall remove the Vayles which he hath on his face, and ſhall ſhew his glorious viſage to all the <hi>Moores,</hi> and they ſhall all fall to the ground through the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which ſhall proceed from the face of God, and then God ſhall ſay, O my ſervants, ariſe and rejoyce in my glory, without fear of ever dying, much leſs of being ſad or diſcontented to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie; Then (ſayes he) they ſhall lift up their heads, and ſee and behold God face to face, in which Viſion they ſhall take delight and content.</p>
               <p>Hee ſayth, That after they have ſeen
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:169729:101"/>
God they ſhall all goe from this place to the other Paradiſes, to wit, every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with his Virgin ſhall goe into his own Palace or manſion, perpetually and eternally eating, drinking, and taking his pleaſure, joyfull and without ſorrow or fear of ever dying, or having any hurt.</p>
               <p>After this manner the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné</hi> deſcribe the glory of the other world; The ſaid banquet ſhall be made in the Paradiſe called <hi>Genete Alcoduz,</hi> but <hi>Muhamed</hi> will make another feaſt to all the <hi>Moores</hi> at his ſaid fountain called <hi>Alcauzar,</hi> and ſhall give them drink with his own hand as the <hi>Suné</hi> ſays, and in the book called in <hi>Arabick Quitebe Alainiar</hi> (i. e.) the book of flowers, the words in <hi>Arabick</hi> run thus, <hi>Aneguaque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin hale, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) that <hi>Muhumed</hi> will be at his fountain, and the <hi>Mooriſh</hi> people ſhall paſſe by it, and <hi>Muhamed</hi> with his own hand ſhall give every one of them to drink of the water of that fountaine, and thoſe that drink of this fonntaine he ſayth ſhall never thirſt. In the ſaid book of <hi>flowers, Muhamed</hi> ſayes that the water
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:169729:101"/>
of this fountaine is whiter then milk and ſweeter than honey, and the buckets, bowles and glaſſes of this fountain are as many in number as the Stars of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Now I will ſpeak to thee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> and ſay ſomething upon this glory which yee <hi>Moores</hi> are to enjoy in the other world, and although I am weary and troubled with writing ſo many gulleryes, and things againſt reaſon and all Law, nevertheleſſe I will ſpeak of two things which I find wanting in your Paradiſe, and in all the glory aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>The firſt defect is, that whereas the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné</hi> hold forth ſuch and ſo great Paradiſes, ſo ſtately built and ſo richly adorned, they make no mention of Eaſements, and that they are alſo magnificently built; eſpecially having ſpoken of ſo much eating, and of ſo much drinking, <hi>viz.</hi> of honey, milk, Claret, and Hypocras.</p>
               <p>The ſecond defect is, that he makes no mention of the glory of the women; for whereas the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné</hi>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:169729:102"/>
have promiſed, that the men ſhall have chaſt Virgins with whom they ſhall ſport and take their pleaſure as aforeſaid, they ought in like manner to have mentioned the women, and to have given them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſervants, to have taken their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure with them, and then the women would alſo have had eternall glory.</p>
               <p>But tell mee <hi>O Moore,</hi> what will the women who ſhall be at this feaſt, ſay and doe, when they ſhall ſee themſelves com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe, and when they ſhall ſee their husbands which they had in this world, ſporting with and embracing their Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the ſpace of 50 years, which he ſays they ſhall remaine embraced, ſporting and taking their pleaſures; Therefore <hi>O Moore,</hi> I ſay, that the womens glory will be turned into puniſhment, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, eſpecially when each of the men ſhall take his Virgin, and ſhall goe away with her to his <hi>Manſion</hi> or fortreſſe, and the women ſhall be left alone and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe like widdowes; ſo that, <hi>O Moore,</hi> conſidering all this above, thou mayeſt conclude that this is not a thing of God,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:169729:102"/>
nor of a Prophet and meſſenger ſent from God, and thou wilt know, that it is all as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſays <hi>Vanity of Vanities</hi> and all Vanity; and here I will conclude this ninth Chapter.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THe <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the firſt Chapter of the firſt book, in the firſt Chapter of the ſecond book, and in the firſt Chapter of the fourth book, ſays, that God curſed the devill, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him from the glory of Paradiſe, and caſt him into the bottomles pit for ever; Likewiſe in the aforequoted Chapters it ſays, that the devill told
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:169729:103"/>
God, that he would alwaies be mans mortall Enemy, and would alwaies tempt men and torment them; further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in divers places admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth men, ſaying, that the Devill is mans apparent enemy, all which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and manifeſt in the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> And after all this, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſays, that the Devills ſhall hear the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and ſhall become the friends of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> of men and of God; and that God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their ſins, and promiſeth them the glory of heaven, as appears by the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>devill,</hi> and <hi>of Caf,</hi> and <hi>of the glorious</hi> in the fourth book; Furthermore the <hi>Alcoran</hi> contradicteth it ſelf, when he ſays in the firſt Chapter of the firſt book, that it was given in the month of <hi>Ramadan,</hi> and in the Chapter <hi>of Smoak,</hi> and in the Chapter <hi>of the Holy night in</hi> the fourth book, he ſays, that the <hi>Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> was given in one night, both which, the courſe of above twenty years-time contradicteth, during which <hi>Muhamed</hi> was making the <hi>Alcoran, viz.</hi> ten years in <hi>Mecca</hi> and 13 years in <hi>Medina,</hi> which
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:169729:103"/>
appears by the titles of the Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> For there are Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> which are called <hi>Sorath Midi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niya;</hi> I mean, that the ſongs or Chapters which were made at <hi>Mecca,</hi> during the ten years that <hi>Muhamed</hi> dwelt there, are called <hi>Sorath Mekiya, (i. e.)</hi> ſongs of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and the Chapters which were made at <hi>Medina</hi> during the thirteen years, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> dwelt there, are called <hi>Sorath Medeniya, (i. e.)</hi> ſongs made at <hi>Medina;</hi> and there is not mention made at <hi>Mecca</hi> in all the ten years of any of thoſe Chapters made at <hi>Medina,</hi> and the Chapters which were made at <hi>Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> were not made at <hi>Medina;</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was twenty three years in compoſing, and did not deſcend in one night, nor in one month, as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſays. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more by the <hi>Alcoran</hi> it ſelf it appears, that it was not inſpired in one night, nor in one month, by the Chapters and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which were made upon ſeverall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as upon actions, offences, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on controverſies &amp; differences between
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:169729:104"/>
                  <hi>Muhamed</hi> and his wives; and by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of commandements, and by the alterations which wee have ſhewn above, which Acts and occurrences hapned during the thirteen years which <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> dwelt at <hi>Medina,</hi> and there is no mention made of them at <hi>Mecca,</hi> during the firſt ten years that he dwelt there; How is it then, <hi>O Moore,</hi> that thou ſayeſt the <hi>Alcoran</hi> deſcended in a night, or in a month? And if wee ſhould ſay, it is true that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> deſcended in a night or in a month, then I would have thee tell mee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> where was this night or this month? Whether it were at <hi>Medina,</hi> or at <hi>Mecca?</hi> if thou ſayeſt that it was at <hi>Mecca,</hi> then I anſwer, that thoſe Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which were made at <hi>Medina</hi> are not to be reputed or judged for the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> and if thou ſayeſt that this night was at <hi>Medina,</hi> then I ſay likewiſe that the Chapters and verſes made at <hi>Mecca,</hi> are not to be reputed for the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> ſo that take it which way you will, we muſt ſay, that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſays and unſays, affirmes and denies the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:169729:104"/>
Furthermore, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> contradict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf when it ſayth in the fourth Chapter of the firſt book, that he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the <hi>Moores</hi> to hold twelve things as forbidden and prohibited to be eaten; In <hi>Arabick</hi> he ſays thus, <hi>O horrimet, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> That God hath forbidden the <hi>Moores</hi> that which is murrain, blood, Swine, that which is offered to Idols, and that which hath bin ſtrangled, that which dyes by the thruſt of a horn, or by a caſualty, and alſo wild beaſts, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> He forbids all theſe things in the ſaid Chapter, the which alſo the <hi>Moores</hi> doe hold for prohibited; And in another ſong in the fifth Chapter of the firſt Book God commands and chargeth <hi>Muhamed,</hi> to tell the <hi>Moores,</hi> that they ſhould ſay nothing was prohibited and forbidden to be eaten or drunk, but murrain, blood, Swines fleſh, and that which is offered to Idols; the ſaid ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in <hi>Arabick</hi> ſayes thus, <hi>O Zolle agido,</hi> &amp;c. So that the <hi>Moores</hi> in the firſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter forbad twelve things, and in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chapter (contradicting themſelves)
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:169729:105"/>
they forbid but four; And if thou wilt ſay, <hi>O Moore,</hi> that the verſes of the laſt Chapter are revoked by the firſt, I prove, that the firſt, (much leſs the laſt,) are not revoked, but are verſes which remain in force and vertue, and which are called in <hi>Arabick Ayetum Mohque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metum</hi> (i. e.) deciſory and valid verſes; Nay it is not found in all the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> that any former verſe revokes the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; for it may be reaſonable that the ſecond may revoke the firſt, but not that the firſt ſhould revoke the ſecond; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſay, that if the firſt verſe is valid and deciſory, the ſecond verſe muſt likewiſe be valid and deciſory; and this was ſo concluded amongſt the <hi>Moores, viz.</hi> That both the verſes ſhould be valid and deciſory. What ſayſt thou now, <hi>O Moore,</hi> in this great confuſion, where one verſe forbids twelve things, and the other forbids but four; for hence it plainly appears, that theſe are not verſes of God, nor of a Prophet ſent from God.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:169729:105"/>
Chapter of the ſecond book writes that the uſe of wine is allowed, the words in <hi>Arabick</hi> ſay thus, <hi>O guamin Zamarati, &amp;c.</hi> Which ſignifies that of the fruit of the dates of the Palme tree, and of Grapes ye may drink, and take lawfull ſuſtentation; By force of which Verſe the <hi>Moores</hi> drank wine lawfully the ſpace of twelve years, but afterwards upon a fancy which <hi>Muhamed</hi> took, he forbad it by word of mouth, not by the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> ſo that <hi>Muhamed</hi> contradicteth the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> and thus in divers Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters yee find that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicteth it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſayes to <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi> that if he doubted whether the <hi>Alcoran</hi> was of God or of man, he ſhould enquire of the Jews and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who had read the Scripture before him, the words in <hi>Arabick</hi> are thus, <hi>O fainz unte,</hi> &amp;c. (i. e. <hi>verbatim) O Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed,</hi> if thou doubteſt or art uncertain of this <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which we have cauſed to be ſent down to thee, aske of thoſe who have read the Scripture before
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:169729:106"/>
thee; All the gloſſers ſay, that they who had read the Scripture are the Jews and Chriſtians; and yet in the firſt Chapter of the firſt book, he ſayes that the Jews and Chriſtians have no Law, and that they erre, and the ſame <hi>Alcoran</hi> calls the Jews curſed, and the Chriſtians erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious; Furthermore in divers places he ſpeaks well of the Jews and Chriſtians, and ſayes that the <hi>Thora</hi> or Law is the true book of God, and that God ſent the ſaid Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> good and true; by which Law the Prophets and meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers doe judge, and all thoſe who doe not judge by the <hi>Thora</hi> are unjuſt, and unbelievers in God; the words in <hi>Arabick</hi> in the fourth Chapter of the firſt book run thus, <hi>Ogua anzelne, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e. <hi>verbatim.)</hi> We God ſent the <hi>Thora</hi> (which is the Law of <hi>Moſes)</hi> a Light, and ſtreight path, by which the Prophets doe judge, and they who doe not judge by this which God ſent to the world, are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidels and unrighteous; Likewiſe he ſays, that the Goſpell is the Light, Life, Law, and Salvation of men; and yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:169729:106"/>
he ſays, that the Chriſtians and Jews have no Law, and that they are curſed and erronious.</p>
               <p>And if thou, <hi>O Moore,</hi> ſayeſt, (as all the <hi>Moores</hi> generally doe,) That the <hi>Thora</hi> and the Evangeliſts are not now what they were in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the time of Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Chriſtians have altered the Goſpell, and the Jews have perverted the <hi>Thora;</hi> To that I will anſwer <hi>O Moore,</hi> and ſay, that that Argument is not good for two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; The firſt and principall, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Thora,</hi> is, that the ſame books and Chapters which the Jews had in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and in the time of the Prophets untill Jeſus Chriſt, the very ſame they have ſtill, and the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans have alwaies had them without wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a tittle, &amp; not only the <hi>Thora</hi> which is the five books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but alſo all the old Teſtament; Now, thou knoweſt, <hi>O Moore,</hi> that the Jews and Chriſtians differ in Worſhip, ſo that if the Jews had changed and altered the Scripture, it would not have continued one and the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:169729:107"/>
ſame, in the hands of the Jews, and in the hands of the Chriſtians, as now it is, and hath alwaies been. The reaſon, O ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt <hi>Moore,</hi> is, becauſe the Scripture was given by God, and that Scripture which is given by God, will never be loſt, as are the books of <hi>Muhamed</hi>'s <hi>Suné,</hi> As we have ſaid above in the third Chapter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe that when <hi>Muhamed</hi> publiſhed his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it was already 600. years, ſince the Chriſtian Law or Religion had been Preached to all the world, and ſo long alſo had the old Teſtament and the new been united, to wit, the figure, and the thing figured, ſo concordant and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious, as if they had been both one and the ſame thing. And ſeeing God commanded <hi>Muhamed</hi> to inquire of the Readers of this Scripture for his infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Scripture doubtleſs was then good and true; and is likewiſe at preſent good and true, for the ſame as it then was, it ſtill is, and if it had been altered at the time of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> God ſhould have given <hi>Muhamed</hi> notice of it, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:169729:107"/>
have given him to know, that at firſt it was good, but then bad, ſo that <hi>O Moore,</hi> thou haſt no right on thy ſide, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding whatſoever the <hi>Moores,</hi> and <hi>Muſſelmen</hi> ſay, for he that brings the teſtimony of two for proof of his own cauſe, doth yield that thoſe witneſſes are good and true, not bad and reprochable, becauſe if they were reprochable and of ill fame, they are not worthy to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for witneſſes; now if God bids <hi>Muhamed</hi> to inquire of the Jews and Chriſtians for his own information, and ſatisfie himſelf from their two Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, you muſt conclude <hi>O Moore;</hi> that thoſe Scriptures at the time of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, were good and true, as ſtill they are, and will alwaies be; and for this Reaſon <hi>O Moore,</hi> thou muſt be ſilent, and acknowledge, that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth it ſelf in divers places; and ſo I will conclude this point.</p>
               <p>Concerning the ſuperfluous, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modeſt things which <hi>Muhamed</hi> hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the <hi>Alchoran;</hi> the firſt is that which he ſpeaks of, in the firſt Chapter
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:169729:108"/>
of the firſt Book, which in <hi>Arabick</hi> ſaies thus, <hi>Oniz Uquum, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) O, yee <hi>Moores,</hi> your Wives, are your ground, therefore caſt ſeed into them, as you pleaſe; which Text, or verſe, is filthie, villanous, and immodeſt of it ſelf, and extreme ſuperfluous; but the Gloſſers of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in expounding, and excuſing it have polluted it more, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thoſe words <hi>as yee pleaſe,</hi> doe not intend otherwiſe than at the uſuall Orifice, but alſo, that a man may lye with his Wife after what manner hee pleaſeth, either ſtanding, ſide-wayes, filewayes, or in any other poſture; So that although the Text of it ſelf be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie and baudie, yet the Gloſs and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereon is far worſe.</p>
               <p>Now tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> what thinkeſt thou of this verſe of the <hi>Alcoran?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch diſcourſes ought not to be written in a Book which you ſay is the word of God, at leaſt all the <hi>Moores</hi> muſt ſay, that God will here teach you how you ſhould uſe your Wives, which is not a reaſonable excuſe, for we doe
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:169729:108"/>
not read that God taught <hi>Adam</hi> which way he ſhould lye with his Wife, though they were the firſt married Couple in the world; therefore I ſay, that this verſe is ſuperfluous and baſe, and the gloſs far more filthy; for the Scripture of God ſhould not mention a thing ſo naturall to men, eſpecially in the ſeventh age of the world; and which is not only naturall to men, but alſo to bruit beaſts and birds.</p>
               <p>Now ſpeak thou <hi>Moore,</hi> who art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas; Doſt thou not obſerve the baſhfulneſs which the Camels uſe in this Act, for when the Male will Couple with the Female, hee never doth it but in the night, and in ſome obſcure place, where he may not be ſeen of Man or beaſt, and if ſuch modeſty or baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs be found amongſt bruit beaſts, how much more ought it to be uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt men.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſets down ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther filthineſs and baſeneſs, ſaying in the firſt Chapter of the firſt Book, that the <hi>Moore</hi> who repudiats and puts away his
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:169729:109"/>
wife once, yea twice, may take her again, if the parties be agreed; but if he puts her away the third time, he cannot take her again, untill ſhe have known ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther husband. Now tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> if thou regardeſt God, what avails it this woman, that the firſt and ſecond time ſhe muſt only return to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and that the third time ſhe may not return untill ſhe have lyen with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther husband? for it ſeems to be very void of Reaſon, and is an immodeſt, and a very ſuperfluous expreſſion; and it doth not become God or a Prophet to ſpeak of ſuch things: this is what hee ſaith in the firſt Chapter of the firſt book; The words are in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus, <hi>O Attalcaco, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> that a woman re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudiated once, or twice, may return to her husband, but if ſhe be repudiated the third time, ſhe cannot return to her former husband, untill another husband hath had to doe with her.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſaies, and laies down many ſuperfluous things, which have no reaſon in them, and are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:169729:109"/>
unneceſſary, as is the ſtory of <hi>King Alexander,</hi> whom they call in <hi>Arabick, Dulzarnaini,</hi> in the twelfth Chapter of the ſecond-Book, where hee ſaies that this <hi>King Alexander</hi> went to the place where the Sun ſetteth, and from whence it riſeth, and that he daily ſaw the Sun ſet in a hot Fountain; the which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth Philoſophie. Likewiſe in the ſame Chapter he relates another ſtory of what befell <hi>Moſes,</hi> and his ſervant, and <hi>Enoch,</hi> whom they call in <hi>Arabick, Alhadir;</hi> of which ſtory there is no mention in all the Bible. Now tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> who art an Aſtrologer, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be conſonant to Reaſon and truth, that the Sun which is in the fourth hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſhould daily ſet in a hot or a cold fountain? doth it not appear to thee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> to be againſt Aſtrologie and Reaſon? Likewiſe he tells another ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of King <hi>Alexander,</hi> in the ſame Chapter, how he lockt up the Lake with bars of Iron, and melted Lead, that thoſe of <hi>Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog</hi> might not paſs; divers other the like ſtories the <hi>Alcoran</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:169729:110"/>
mentions, which are unreaſonable, and altogether needleſs, and which I omit, becauſe I would not be too tedious.</p>
               <p>But obſerve and conſider, <hi>O Moore,</hi> that if the ſaid Hiſtories were true, they would all be found in the Bible; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not true, therefore are they not found any where but in the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> and not in any Authentique wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; wherefore, I ſay, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> had done enough iſ he had inſerted into his <hi>Alcoran</hi> the hiſtories which are in the Bible. But in regard he put down no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what the two Cutlers told him, he hath inſerted ſtories like the perſons. Now ſpeak, <hi>O Moore,</hi> and compare the hiſtories which <hi>Moſes</hi> mentioneth in his five Books, called in <hi>Arabick</hi> the <hi>Thora,</hi> and obſerve their order, and their Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and how they follow each other in order and good Computation, and what diſtance of time there was from <hi>Adam</hi> unto <hi>Noah,</hi> and from <hi>Noah</hi> unto the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, and from the Deluge unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from <hi>Moſes</hi> unto <hi>David,</hi> and from <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:169729:110"/>
to Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; without fayling in a day or a moment of Time; whence it truly appears that it is Divine, and truly inſpired by God, and ordained by his will, and then, <hi>O Moore,</hi> obſerve the order of the hiſtories of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and thou ſhalt ſee that he keeps no order or ſucceſſion of time, for he puts the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Abraham</hi> before that of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the hiſtory of <hi>Joſeph</hi> before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and the hiſtory of <hi>David</hi> before <hi>Moſes,</hi> and doth not make the Accompt true, for he ſaies that <hi>Mary</hi> the Siſter of <hi>Aaron</hi> was the Mother of Jeſus Chriſt, and that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was the ſiſter of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> wherein his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cout faileth above 1500. years. Thou ſhouldeſt likewiſe, <hi>O Moore,</hi> conſider, that <hi>Moſes</hi> hath ſet down the Hiſtorie of the Creation of the World once, in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and ſets down the Hiſtory of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> once, and how they ſinned, and were caſt out into the earth, once in a Chapter by it ſelf; he hath alſo ſet down the hiſtory of <hi>Noah,</hi> and of the Deluge, and of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:169729:111"/>
Ark once, ſo alſo are ſet down the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of <hi>Abraham, Lot, Jacob, Joſeph, Moſes, David,</hi> and of all the Patriarks and Prophets, each hiſtory once, and each orderly in its Chapter; and thou wilt ſee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> and obſerve that <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> ſets down the ſaid hiſtories in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> 12. 15. 16. 20. times, yea, even without order, for he puts the laſt firſt, and the firſt laſt; and ſo thou wilt come to know, that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> is not of God, nor ſent from God by his Angell, as <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſaies.</p>
               <p>Now tell me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> what availeth it, or what Reaſon is there to inſert the ſame Hiſtory ſo often, and every time in Rymes and Conſonance, after the manner of meaſured verſes; Hence it was that they of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and the <hi>Jewes</hi> of <hi>Medina</hi> ſaid, that this <hi>Alcoran</hi> was nothing but old ſtories put in Ryme by <hi>Muhamed,</hi> who was a Poet; and this ſaying is in many places of the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> I think above a hundred, calling him in <hi>Arabick, Sair,</hi> which we call a Poet; and thus, <hi>O Moore,</hi> I tell thee, that thou haſt
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:169729:111"/>
no other anſwer but ſilence. And thus thou mayeſt come to know the Truth, and how unprofitable it is to ſet down the ſame hiſtory ſo often, and to make many verſes of one thing, thereby to make the writing larger.</p>
               <p>Futhermore thou oughteſt, <hi>O Moore,</hi> to conſider and obſerve the order which is in the Holy Evangeliſts of <hi>Mathew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and how they ſucceed each other in order with their Chapters, Acts, Myſteries, and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and how every one is inſerted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its order and reaſon, and how all the Acts and Miracles are done, and ſet down in their places, which is a moſt neceſſary thing and not ſuperfluous, and ſhewes that the Evangeliſts are of God, and the work of the Holy Ghoſt; not forged by Cutlers whom <hi>Muhamed</hi> thought were learned men, and of whom he learnt, and daily wrote down what they dictated and taught him; whereby they ruined <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and made him inſert ſo many vanities in his <hi>Alcoran.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:169729:112"/>
Likewiſe, <hi>O Moore,</hi> thou ſhouldeſt conſider and obſerve the Miracles which are ſet down in the five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> did, and which thy <hi>Alcoran</hi> mentions, and likewiſe conſider the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles which Jeſus Chriſt wrought, which are related in the Evangeliſts, and which the <hi>Alcoran</hi> alſo mentions, and thou wilt ſee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> what difference there is between thoſe Miracles, and the Miracles which <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſaies he wrote, as you may ſee by ſome miracles under-mentioned which <hi>Muhamed</hi> did, which when I have related to thee, thou wilt, <hi>O Moore,</hi> come to know and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Miracles which were done by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by Jeſus Chriſt, were done of Charity, and according to the need or want which required them, and thou wilt ſee that they were divine, true, and ſupernaturall, and done in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thouſands of men and women, and on the other ſide thou wilt ſee, that <hi>Muhamed's</hi> miracles were done needleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without Charity, and not in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of multitudes of men, no not of a
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:169729:112"/>
few, but only done and teſtified by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone; for we doe not read of any miracle of <hi>Muhamed</hi> done in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of other men, but only himſelf ſaies it, as is the miracle of the Dream or Viſion, and of <hi>Alborack,</hi> and of the Angell when he came to him, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall others, which I will relate here, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which miracles you ſhal not find one man to witneſs any one Miracle of all thoſe which he hath written.</p>
               <p>The firſt Miracle is that which is mentioned above, in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Muhamed's</hi> life, when the Angell <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> launched his ſtomack, and pulled out his heart, and took out the black coar, as we have related above; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Miracle, we doe not read in all the Law of the <hi>Moores,</hi> that any one ſaw it done.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Miracle is that which <hi>Muhamed</hi> reports of the Cloud; the book <hi>Azar</hi> ſaies, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Camels of his Maſter, <hi>Gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diza's</hi> husband, in the journey one day it chanced to be very hot, through the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:169729:113"/>
great Sun-ſhine, and a Cloud ſetled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Muhameds</hi> head, and followed him, and over-ſhadowed him all the way. <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſaies, this happened, when he was 16. or 17. years old, but doth not allege any witneſs, that ſaw the Cloud follow him, and overſhadow him.</p>
               <p>The third Miracle was, when the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid Angell came to him to the Cave and ſaluted him, and began to give him the Law and the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> as it is ſaid in the firſt Chapter of <hi>Muhamed's</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>The fourth Miracle was that where <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſaies, that the beaſts, ſtones, trees, and birds greeted him, and ſpake to him. The book <hi>Azar</hi> ſaies, that when <hi>Muhamed</hi> had received the Embaſſage from the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> in the ſaid Cave, as he returned home, all the beaſts, birds, trees, and ſtones greeted him, and ſaid to him, Rejoyce, <hi>O Muhamed,</hi> for thou art the Prophet, and meſſenger of God, and that <hi>Muhamed</hi> going alongſt the Path, there lay the Trunk of a Tree in the way, inſomuch that <hi>Muhamed</hi> was
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:169729:113"/>
about to turn another way, but becauſe he ſhould not goe out of his way, the tree was cleft aſunder in the midſt, and ſo <hi>Muhamed</hi> paſſed through the middle of the tree, and aſſoon as he was paſſed, the tree grew togither again as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; all this <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſaies hapned to him, and yet there was no one ſaw it; neither were theſe Miracles at all need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, nor done of Charity, nor in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of others.</p>
               <p>The fift Miracle was when the Trees came to be a ſhadow unto <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and after they had ſhadowed him, they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to their own places again at his command; In the <hi>Suné</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>Muhamed</hi> reported, that being one day uncovered in the fields, he had occaſion to untruſs, during which the Sun ſhone ſo hot on his head, that he was all in a ſweat; Whereupon he looked towards certain Trees which were far from him, and called them, and bade them come and ſhadow him, and he ſaies that at the ſame inſtant, there came two trees tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the earth with their roots, till they
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:169729:114"/>
came to the place where <hi>Muhamed</hi> was, and there they ſhadowed him; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <hi>Muhamed</hi> commanded the ſaid Trees to return to their places again, the which they did, and the earth cloſed up again, as it was at firſt; the words in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick,</hi> ſay thus; <hi>O Guafidubaique, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> that <hi>Muhamed</hi> called the trees to come to him, and by the Divine will they came very obediently with their boughs. And afterwards hee comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them to return to their places with their roots.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Miracle was when the Moon divided it ſelf into two pieces; the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> in the Chapter <hi>of the Moon,</hi> in the fourth book, ſaies, that the Moon divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it ſelf in the midſt; and the gloſs, and the book of <hi>Azar,</hi> upon this Text, ſay, That <hi>Muhamed</hi> reported, that one night an Uncle of his called <hi>Bugel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> who was the moſt potent of his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, came and ſaid to him, <hi>O Muhamed,</hi> if thou wilt doe a miracle which I ſhall require, I will preſently become <hi>Moore</hi> and <hi>Muſſelman,</hi> and will believe that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:169729:114"/>
thou art a Prophet, unto whom <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> anſwered and ſaid, that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Then his Uncle told him, that if hee could make the Moon come to the midſt of Heaven, and be in the Full, (whereas ſhe was then, as the ſaid books report, twenty one dayes old) and if the Moon did divide it ſelf in the midſt, and come out of Heaven to the Earth, and thoſe two pieces goe, the one through the hole of one of <hi>Muhameds</hi> ſleeves, and the other piece through the hole of the other ſleeve, and both pieces come out of the Coller of <hi>Muhameds</hi> Coat, ſpeaking and ſaying that <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> was the Prophet of God, and joyn themſelves together again, and return again to heaven where they were at firſt; if hee did all this, hee promiſed to be converted, and to become a <hi>Moore</hi> and <hi>Muſſelman.</hi> The Books a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid ſay, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> prayed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and beſeeched him for his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power to doe all that his Uncle demanded, and they ſay, that the Moon preſently came into the midſt of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:169729:115"/>
full, and divided it ſelf in the midſt, and deſcended, and did what is above recited; and after all was done, his Uncle anſwered, ſaying, that it was all done by the Art of Negromancie; theſe words the ſaid Chapter there mentions, and in <hi>Arabick</hi> they are thus, <hi>Ogua iniaran aeyten: (i. e.)</hi> the wicked ſay, that it was a manifeſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Miracle was, when the trunk of the Palme tree wept; the book of <hi>Azar</hi> ſaies, that the night when <hi>Muhamed</hi> departed from <hi>Mecca</hi> to goe to <hi>Medina,</hi> (which departure the <hi>Moores</hi> call <hi>Alhigera (i. e.)</hi> Lapidation, or baniſhment;) <hi>Muhamed</hi> had a dry Trunk of a Palm tree in his houſe, and becauſe that the night of his departure after midnight the Trunk was very moiſt, <hi>Muhamed</hi> called the <hi>Moores,</hi> and deſired them to come and ſee a great miracle. The <hi>Moores</hi> anſwered, that they deſired nothing elſe but to ſee Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, then he brought them all where the trunk lay, and bad them touch the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:169729:115"/>
Trunk with their hands, and ſee how the Trunk wept for <hi>Muhameds</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>
               <p>Theſe are his greateſt miracles, and the moſt authentique amongſt the <hi>Moores. Muhamed</hi> ſaies, that he did all the Miracles above-mentioned, but hee doth not mention any witneſſe that ſaw any one of them done; Concerning which Miracles there might be great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments made, which I omit, for fear of being too tedious, but ſhall leave them to the Readers own judgement, that I may conclude this Chapter; for if I ſhould ſet down all the Miracles which we read of, and are reported in the <hi>Suné</hi> to be done by <hi>Muhamed,</hi> they could not be comprized in twenty five quires of paper; for the <hi>Suné,</hi> and all the ſix books report, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> did a thouſand ſuch Miracles.</p>

Likewiſe the Angelick ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the words which the Virgin and the Angell had together, as they are in the Goſpell; and that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> ſaid how can it be, and that the Angell anſwered her, the holy Ghoſt ſhall come into thee, and the power of the moſt high ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaddow thee; and that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> conſented, and was impregnated by the operation of the holy Ghoſt; and that Jeſus Chriſt our Lord was born of a moſt glorious and miraculous birth; and that he did all ſupernaturall miracles; dyed, roſe again, and aſcended to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his own power; and how he muſt come again to the earth to judgement as the true Judge; and that his diſciples were holy men, and wrought divers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, rayſing the dead, and healing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſes, and mentioneth ſome Saints and Chriſtian Martyrs; All this above, I will prove by the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Furthermore in the firſt Chapter of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:169729:117"/>
the firſt book he ſays in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus; <hi>O delique, &amp;c.

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:169729:117"/>
Law of Jeſus Chriſt is in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> approved for good and holy.</p>
               <p>Concerning the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> in the ſecond Chapter of the firſt Book, which is called the Chapter <hi>of the generation of</hi> Joakim <hi>the Father of the Virgin</hi> Mary, he ſayes in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus, <hi>O Guait calet, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That when <hi>Anne, Joakims</hi> wife, was with child of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſhe ſaid, O, my Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, I freely offer unto thy ſervice what I bear in my womb, therefore hear me, O Lord, for thou giveſt ear, and art wiſe; and when her time was out, ſhe brought forth a woman child, which birth was holy, and ſhe called the child <hi>Mary,</hi> and prayed God that ſhe and her child might be protected and defended from the temptations of the Devill; and the Commentators on the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> ſay and conclude on this place, that only Jeſus Chriſt and <hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, were exempted from the temptation of the Devill, and they firmly hold that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was Conceived without originall ſin; in the ſaid Chapter he ſaies
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:169729:118"/>
that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> came to divine ſervice at the Temple, when ſhe was a little Maiden, and lived there a moſt holy life, and that <hi>Zacharias</hi> the Father of St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> had the tuition of her, and that ſhe was fed, and nouriſhed with Celeſtiall food, and that Angels diſcourſed and converſed with her. The <hi>Arabick</hi> ſaies thus, <hi>Ogua id, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That the Angell ſaid, O <hi>Mary,</hi> God hath choſen, and purifyed thee, and exalted thee above all the women of all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and preſently he mentions, that ſhe was ſaluted by the Angell <hi>Gabriel,</hi> and that the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> told and diſcovered to her the myſtery of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and that ſhe anſwered the Angell, and did conſent, and was with child; in which words, is contained the <hi>Ave Marie,</hi> and all that which the Holy Goſpell relates, he ſaies in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus, <hi>Ogua Zaleti, &amp;c.</hi> which is the Salutation, and all that which St. <hi>Luke</hi> in his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell ſets down about the myſtery of the Incarnation, <hi>verbatim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning the glorious Nativity of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:169729:118"/>
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he makes men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the firſt Chapter of the third Book, wherein he again relates the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, and all the myſtery of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, which birth was moſt miraculous, and joyfull, and the <hi>Moores</hi> in <hi>Arabick</hi> call it <hi>Almilid,</hi> and the <hi>Moores</hi> and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmen all the world over doe annually that night uſe great feaſting, dancing, and great melody, eſpecially in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque or mosk of <hi>Sciativia</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Valentia;</hi> and of this glorious Nativity the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſaies in <hi>Arabick</hi> in the ſaid firſt Chapter of the third Book, thus, <hi>O Fane dehe, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That when the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was in Labour, ſhe lay under a Palm tree; the gloſſers ſay, that this tree had been dry 30. years; and the Chapter goes on, and ſaies, that when Jeſus Chriſt was born, he told his Mother, that if ſhe would ſhake the tree, there ſhould preſently good and ripe Dates fall from it; the which ſhe did, and the tree became green, and brought forth good ripe Dates; the <hi>Moores</hi> ſay that this Palm-tree groweth to this day, and is freſh and green, and
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:169729:119"/>
doth annually bring forth dates. I Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this, to the end that we may ſee how great reverence the <hi>Moores</hi> bear to Jeſus Chriſt, and doe eſteem him more than any Saint or Prophet in the world, which the <hi>Alcoran</hi> teſtifies in the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and fourth Chapter of the firſt Book ſaying, that Jeſus Chriſt knew the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of mens hearts, raiſed the dead, healed incurable diſeaſes, and cauſed the blind to ſee, and the dumb to ſpeak; all which the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſaies not of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed,</hi> nor of any other Prophet; Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſets down divers excellencies of Chriſts Diſciples, whom he calls <hi>haguarquin</hi> (i. e.) pure, and chaſte; and ſaies that they did miracles above nature, as he writes in the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter of the third Book, that St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> did two miracles in <hi>Antioch, viz.</hi> That they cured a man of a Leproſie, and raiſed the Kings daughter, who had been dead five daies, by which miracles all the men of <hi>Antioch</hi> were converted to the faith of Jeſus Chriſt; which ſtory the <hi>Moores</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:169729:119"/>
read in the <hi>Arabick,</hi> but underſtand it not; in <hi>Arabick</hi> it is thus: <hi>Ogua drib Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum, &amp;c.</hi> Which is in proſe, as the Gloſſerson the <hi>Alcoran</hi> ſay; that St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> (other interpreters ſay, that they were St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> but they all ſay that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and another Apoſtle,) went to the City of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and without the City found a man full of Leproſie, who was called <hi>Habib Anajar,</hi> a very rich man, but becauſe of his diſeaſe he dwelt out of the City; unto whom the two Apoſtles ſpake, and ſaid, that if he beleeved in Jeſus Chriſt and his Law, they would cure him; and he was content, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon believed, and was Baptized, and was preſently cured, and ſeeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cured hee led the Apoſtles to his houſe, and ſet meat before them, and laid them down a thouſand Crowns of gold, for a gratification of his health; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles bad him take away his money, in regard that they did not thoſe things for money, but for love of their Maſter Jeſus Chriſt; The Text in <hi>Arabick</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:169729:120"/>
ſaies thus, <hi>Oguagee minazca, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) That when this man ſaw that he was healed, he went about the City, crying with a loud voice, ſaying, O, my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, follow theſe meſſengers, who lead you to the true Law, and cure without money; all this the Text relates, and proceeds, ſaying, that becauſe he cryed after this manner, the King took him and martyrd him, and the Text ſaies, that as ſoon as this Martyr dyed, hee went to Paradiſe, and then he ſaid, I would to God that my nation knew, that I am in Paradiſe, and doe diſcourſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the honourable, my ſins having been pardoned; theſe words in <hi>Arabick</hi> are, <hi>Ozule yalli te caumi, &amp;c.</hi> and the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory proceeds in the ſame Chapter, and ſaies, that this King after he had martyrd this man, took the two Diſciples, and put them in priſon, but they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently helped out by a third man; in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> the Text ſaies thus, <hi>O faahazezne-bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celicin,</hi> (i. e.) That God ſent them a third man for to help them. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters ſay, that doubtleſs this third
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:169729:120"/>
man was St. <hi>Paul:</hi> and the gloſs ſayes, that the aſſiſtance that <hi>Paul</hi> did unto the two Apoſtles, was, that he went to the King, and told him, that he had heard that his Majeſty had impriſoned two of the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, the King anſwered that it was true, then St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayed the King, that his Majeſty would be pleaſed to doe him a favour, which was, to let the two Diſciples be fetcht from priſon, and brought into his preſence, becauſe he would examin them what manner of men they were, what Law they Preached, and what miracles they wrought, and that it might be they were deluſions; whereupon the King cauſed them to be fetcht out, and brought before him and St. <hi>Paul:</hi> then St. <hi>Paul</hi> began to examine them, as though he had not known them, and asked them what Law they Preached, and what miracles they wrought; and they anſwered that they Preached the Law of Jeſus Chriſt, and that in the name and by the power of Jeſus Chriſt, they gave ſight to the blind, and raiſed
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:169729:121"/>
the dead; then St. <hi>Paul</hi> deſired the King to let one born blind be called for, and there was preſently a child brought in of five years of age, ſtark blind; and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the King, O King, let us goe to ſome of your Idols, and their we ſhall ſee this miracle; he ſaies, that they went to the Temple, and their <hi>Paul</hi> deſired the King, to pray to his Idols to heal the blind; Whereupon the King prayd to his Idols to heal the blind child, which they did not; then ſaid he, heal him yee, and I will believe in the God whom yee preach: then St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> took the blind child and healed him, and the blind came in ſeeing, with fairer eyes than any one in the City; then the King told them, that if they would raiſe his daughter which had been dead five daies, he would become Chriſtian, and all his people likewiſe, and the Gloſſers ſay, that at the ſame time they alſo rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſaid Daughter, and that all the people of <hi>Antioch</hi> were thereupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted; The Text and the gloſs of the <hi>Alcoran</hi> relate all this above; now tell
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:169729:121"/>
me, <hi>O Moore,</hi> who beareſt great devotion to this Chapter, and which amongſt the <hi>Moores</hi> is in as great eſteem and value as the Goſpell of St. <hi>John</hi> is amongſt the Chriſtians, tell me what think you of this above, which you never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood? behold how thy <hi>Alcoran</hi> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that the Apoſtles are Saints, and that St. <hi>Paul</hi> did what is aforeſaid; and for the Martyr, the Text of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter teſtifies, that he went into Paradiſe for being martyred, and for dying in the faith of Jeſus Chriſt; why tarrieſt thou then? <hi>O Moore,</hi> why doſt thou not become a Chriſtian? that thou mayeſt goe to the place where this Chriſtian Martyr is. I believe that divers <hi>Moores</hi> hear this aforeſaid, but doe not believe it; but bid thou the <hi>Moore</hi> which denies it, to read the gloſs of <hi>Alzamaxeri,</hi> and the gloſs of <hi>Buhatia,</hi> and if he doe not find what I have ſet down above, word for word in the ſaid two gloſſes, let him call me the greateſt lyer in the world; This Hiſtory his Grace <hi>Martin Gartia,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Barchinone</hi> hath ſet

down in his Book of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which I tranſlated out of <hi>Arabick,</hi> into the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh tongue by his Graces command, and himſelf hath the ſaid two <hi>Arabick</hi> gloſſaries.</p>
               <p>Yee muſt know that the <hi>Alcoran</hi> holds forth and attributes three excellencies to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which it doth not give to any other of the Prophets; not to <hi>Moſes, Abraham, David,</hi> no nor to <hi>Muhamed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt is that which the <hi>Alcoran</hi> mentions in the ſecond Chapter of the firſt Book, <hi>viz.</hi> That he aſcended to Heaven in Soul and Body, and upon this place the <hi>Suné</hi> ſayes that he muſt come into the world to judge as a juſt Judge; in <hi>Arabick,</hi> and the <hi>Suné</hi> he ſayes thus, <hi>Oguayniziolo, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e) that Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> ſhall come down to the earth, and ſhall be a juſt Judge therein.</p>
               <p>The ſecond excellency which the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> attributes to Jeſus Chriſt is, that it calls him, <hi>Calimethuallah</hi> (i. e.) The word of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:169729:122"/>
The third is, that he is called in the <hi>Alcoran, Rohc alkodus allah</hi> (i. e.) The holy Spirit of God: of which two names never was any man worthy, nor ever will be; ſo that having proved that Jeſus Chriſt is the word of God, and the holy Spirit of God, it is proved that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is the Son of God, and very God; This appears in the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the firſt Book of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which in <hi>Arabick</hi> runs thus, <hi>Omet maze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ho, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) The Meſſras Jeſus the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> is no other than the word of God ſent to <hi>Mary,</hi> the Spirit of God himſelf, and the meſſenger of God; by which words, <hi>O Moore,</hi> thou mayeſt ſee that he declares that Jeſus Chriſt is God and Man.</p>

               <p>NOw, to the end that Chriſtians may not have occaſion or ground to wonder, and much leſs the <hi>Moores</hi> to preſume, I will lay down three cauſes whereby the Sect of the <hi>Moores</hi> hath propagated and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, but not by any goodneſs in it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:169729:123"/>
The firſt cauſe was, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan and inſtituted this Law or Religion of the <hi>Moores,</hi> in a Nation very ruſtick, ignorant, beaſtly, and Idolatrous; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men voyd and deſtitute of all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding, for amongſt that people were no Logicians, Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Philoſophers, nor Phyſicians, but they were all earthly, given to eating, drinking, and luxury; an ignorant and rude people, as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> calls them, in the firſt Chapter of the firſt Book, in <hi>Arabick, Sufeha (i. e.)</hi> ignorant people; The Countrey likewiſe was full of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters aſwell in <hi>Arabia the happy,</hi> as in <hi>Arabia the great,</hi> and throughout all <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Armenia,</hi> where were twelve ſorts or Sects of Idolaters, as we ſhewed in the firſt Chapter of this book, ſome of them worſhiped <hi>a tree,</hi> unto which they Sacrifiſed, and annually celebrated Feaſts, and a kind of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> which tree they called <hi>Detulanger,</hi> the Lord and Captain of the Province where this tree was, in <hi>Muhamed's</hi> time was called <hi>Azamahinali.</hi> Others worſhipped a <hi>great</hi>

                  <hi>ſtatue</hi> made of a black metall, which was three fathoms long, this Idoll was called <hi>Bohinum,</hi> and it was in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Armenia,</hi> the Lord and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of this Idoll, in <hi>Muhameds</hi> time was called <hi>Alquazad.</hi> Others in <hi>Armenia</hi> worſhipped the Sun, and the Prince of that people was called, <hi>Sanharben Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quar.</hi> They of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and the Provinces adjacent, worſhipped <hi>Alzete</hi> and <hi>Alluza,</hi> as we have ſaid before; ſo that <hi>Muhamed</hi> began his Sect amongſt the moſt bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh people in the world, and unto theſe <hi>Muhamed</hi> gave to underſtand that they were Idolaters, and that they ought to worſhip the God of heaven and earth, who was the true God, who had Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Heavens, the Planets, the earth, and the waters; that cauſed rain to fall from heaven, and fruits to proceed from the earth, for Man, and beaſt; that God who cauſed men to dye, and after death to riſe again, for to reward every man according to his deſerts, with glory or puniſhment; that God who created the Paradiſes, with ſo many excellent things
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:169729:124"/>
for the bleſſed; and that God who created Hell, with ſo many Torments for the Damned. All which they of <hi>Mecca,</hi> and the other Idolaters denyed; and by his preaching this aforeſaid to them, (which is the Contents of half the <hi>Alcoran)</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers began to believe in <hi>Muhameds.</hi> Law or Sect; many likewiſe were induced to believe <hi>Muhamed,</hi> by reaſon of the great boaſting and threatning which he uſed, when hee read the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> and the ſcrowles of the Puniſhment of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe who are drowned in the world by the Deluge, and who eſcaped in the Ark of <hi>Noah;</hi> alſo the People of <hi>Lot,</hi> and of the five Cities which are very neer unto <hi>Mecca;</hi> he alſo threatned, and terrified them with the example of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> People, and the nine plagues which God ſent upon them, and told them how they were ſwallowed up in the Sea, becauſe they did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in <hi>Moſes;</hi> hee alſo terrified them with the pains of Hell, and with the horror of the things which hee writes of Hell; which is obvious in divers
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:169729:125"/>
chapters of the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> and thus they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved in <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and were perſwaded that he who Created all things, and hath power over all, was the true God; ſo that whereas <hi>Muhamed</hi> converted them to his own opinion, and made them know nine Articles of the Chriſtian faith, and thoſe other things of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith expreſſed in the precedent Chapter, if he had as well given them knowledge of the whole Chriſtian faith, and had injoyned them to believe all the 12. Articles, and be Baptiſed, he had done very well, and they had all been Chriſtians; but hee would not doe ſo, becauſe he could not that way have made himſelf ſo great as he did. The immoderate ambition wherewith <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamed</hi> was tranſported, hath undone the <hi>Moores,</hi> and been the cauſe of his own and their error, and utter perdition.</p>
               <p>Yet this wee muſt believe, that the <hi>Moores</hi> who believed in God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that he who Created all things viſible, and inviſible, was God, did acknowledge and believe the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:169729:125"/>
Patriarks, and Meſſengers of God, and believed the Scriptures which God ſent by his ſervants, and alſo gave credit to the Evangeliſts, the <hi>Thora,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalter,</hi> and believed <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the other things above mentioned; ſo that I ſay, that although <hi>Muhamed</hi> in his time did ſome wicked things, as we have ſaid before, for which divers <hi>Moores</hi> were offended at him, yet nevertheleſs, they never loſt the faith which they had of God, and the things aforeſaid; for although they were ignorant, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged that Idolatry was a wicked thing, and the way to deſtruction, and ſo they have continued till our dayes, believing all that <hi>Muhamed</hi> made them believe; Wherefore I ſay, that if <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> would, the <hi>Moores</hi> had believed in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and had been all ſaved; but he conceived, that if they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved truly, he ſhould not have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for a Prophet, nor a Law-giver, nor a great Lord, and this deteſtable Ambition deceived <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and after him deceived his Diſciples, as here un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:169729:126"/>
will appear; ſo that <hi>Muhamed</hi> made the <hi>Moores</hi> believe a great part of the Chriſtian Law, but not all, for fear leſt they ſhould become Chriſtians; &amp; he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo made them believe a great part of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Law, but not all, for fear leſt they ſhould become <hi>Jewes;</hi> and made them alſo believe the <hi>Alcoran</hi> and the <hi>Suné,</hi> and ſo many other fooleries, which wee have mentioned above, that he might make them <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Muſſelmen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this manner the Sect of the <hi>Moores</hi> increaſed, not by any reaſon or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency it had in it ſelf; for if <hi>Muhamed</hi> had begun his Sect among Philoſophers, Logicians, and Aſtrologers, and a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that had had any Law, it had never had any progreſſe; the which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Jeſus Chriſt did; for they preached the faith of Jeſus Chriſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the moſt learned of all the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and amongſt the Aſtrologers, Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Philoſophers of the Gentiles, yea, without Arms or Battells, and only by their preaching the Law of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Goſpell, and by their

miracles, they converted all the World to the Catholique and Chriſtian faith; beſides, the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, wrought not that converſion meerly by preaching, and doing miracles, but alſo by diſputing and arguing of the truth, and by confuting Heretiques and wicked men, who gainſaid them; and thus the Chriſtian faith was agitated and exalted by diſputations, untill it inlightned all places, the which the Law or ſect of <hi>Muhamed</hi> cannot endure; for <hi>Muhameds</hi> ſect will not be queſtioned by Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor be examined by naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; for ſo the <hi>Alcoran</hi> commands in the ninth Chapter of the third Book, where he ſaies; <hi>Guale tugedilo, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> never diſpute you with the <hi>Jewes</hi> or Chriſtians; Wherefore I ſay, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>Muhamed</hi> withdrew the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Mecca</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> from the error of Idolatry, and brought them into he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, doing like thoſe who adminiſter fatall Phyſick, which they hide in good tooth ſome food, and they who eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thinking they eat ſome delicate Cates
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:169729:127"/>
are poiſoned. Thus did <hi>Muhamed</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing and mingling his falſe Law, and his Impoſtures, and deluſions among the holy and good things of the Old and New Teſtament, yea, with things of the Law of Nature, and ſo he made a Law and Sect which deſtroyes thoſe eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that believe it, even as adulterated medicines kill thoſe that take them. And let this be ſufficient for the firſt cauſe or reaſon of the propagation of <hi>Muhameds</hi> Law.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Cauſe of the growth and increaſe of <hi>Muhamed's</hi> Law was thus; <hi>Muhamed</hi> ſeeing that divers rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him for the cauſes aforeſaid, and returned to their former opinions, and required him to doe miracles, and to cauſe ſigns to appear from heaven, as <hi>Noah</hi> did with the Ark, and <hi>Moſes</hi> who cauſed <hi>Manna</hi> to fall from heaven forty years, and made twelve Fountains of water to ſpring out of a Rock, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the red Sea into twelve Paſſages, and <hi>Muhamed</hi> not being able to doe the like, he thought his Law could not bee
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:169729:127"/>
advanced any other way than by the Sword; to wit, by fighting with unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and bringing them to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of his Law by force; and for that purpoſe he began to make verſes in the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> ſaying, that God commanded them to fight againſt the unbeleevers and rebellious, and upon that Argument made a Chapter, which is the third Chapter of the ſecond Book, all in the Tearms and commands of a Warriour; Wherein he ſets down one verſe, which is called the <hi>Verſe of the Sword,</hi> and from this Verſe the whole Chapter is called <hi>the Chapter of the Sword;</hi> which Verſe is in <hi>Arabick</hi> thus; <hi>O Zaltihum, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> ſlay the Enemies and Unbeleevers, and ſo they ſhall be tormented, and confounded by you; in the <hi>Suné</hi> he ſaies thus, <hi>Ozati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luanne, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> Kill them untill they all become <hi>Moores</hi> and beleevers; Which command <hi>Muhamed</hi> hath reiterated in divers Chapters of the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> but indeed he uſed great policie in it, and brought his purpoſe about very ſubtilly, to wit, that in ſuch a kind of War there
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:169729:128"/>
muſt be ſome partiality, and certain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Captains, or otherwiſe it could not be; for which purpoſe he ſent for ten Men, who were already converted to his Sect, of the chiefeſt of all <hi>Arabia felix,</hi> and <hi>Arabia magna,</hi> men much fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and potent, and of themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in Arms, and well exerciſed in the Art of War; the firſt and chief of them was called <hi>Ubequar,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Homar,</hi> and theſe two were <hi>Muhameds</hi> fathers-in-law. The third was called <hi>Hozman,</hi> who collected the <hi>Alcoran.</hi> The fourth was <hi>Alifrello,</hi> a Couſin of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and theſe were all of <hi>Muhameds</hi> kindred. The fifth was called <hi>Talha.</hi> The ſixth <hi>Azubere.</hi> The ſeventh <hi>Zadin.</hi> The eighth <hi>Zahedin.</hi> The ninth <hi>Abdorazmen;</hi> and the tenth <hi>Abuhobeyde.</hi> Theſe he conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and aſſembled under a Tree abroad in the fields, and there began to preach a Sermon to them, which were too long to repeat here; In brief, hee told them that he was ſent from God, for to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his People from Idolatry, and that they knew, that there were divers <hi>Jewes,</hi>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:169729:128"/>
and ſeverall other Rebellious perſons who oppoſed his Law, and that it was neceſſary that his Law ſhould be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and exalted above all other Lawes, (which Verſe is inſerted into the third Chapter of the Sword of the ſecond book) then he read to them the Verſes and Chapters which were in the ſaid <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran,</hi> and told them that God had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly commanded this way of making warre, and that for his part he could doe no good in it without having Captains, and Leaders for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe Commanders and Gentlemen found it not good that he ſhould have any other than themſelves, and were content to take the charge upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to ſide with <hi>Muhumed</hi> and thoſe of his party, and reſolved to dye, both they and theirs in the advancing of the Law of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> and in making war againſt their own Fathers, Mothers, Brethren, and Kindred, and thereupon took an oath, and ſwore to have <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> for their Lord, Prophet, and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and he ſwore likewiſe to hold them
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:169729:129"/>
for his ſons and brethren, and promiſed them Paradiſe, and that they ſhould not be bound to give an account of their ſins; this is contained in the 13th Chap. of the 4th Book, where he ſaies in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> thus, <hi>O idyobeyhune, &amp;c. (i. e.)</hi> that <hi>Muhameds</hi> diſciples ſwore unto him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tree; and ſo <hi>Muhamed</hi> with his Captains and their followers whom he had already converted, began to make war; and the firſt incounter which they had, was with 300. Gentlemen of <hi>Mecca,</hi> neer unto a River, called the River of <hi>Bedrin,</hi> where they of <hi>Mecca</hi> were all overthrown, and put to the ſword; and afterwards <hi>Muhamed</hi> fought twelve bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tells againſt the <hi>Jewes,</hi> untill hee had vanquiſhed all the <hi>Jewes</hi> which were at <hi>Medina,</hi> and the Countries adjacent, and thoſe which remained alive, became tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butary to the <hi>Moores;</hi> and ſo in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time by wars, bloodſhed, and large promiſes, the ſect of <hi>Muhamed</hi> increaſed, untill he at laſt conquered <hi>Mecca,</hi> and all the Countrey adjacent, and gained likewiſe all <hi>Arabia Felix,</hi>
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:169729:129"/>
and <hi>Arrabia Magna,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Armenia</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> before he dyed; and when he was dead, the Primacy devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the <hi>Caliph</hi> or King <hi>Ubequar</hi> his father-in-Law, in whoſe time the ſtrength of the <hi>Moores</hi> was increaſed to threeſcore thouſand horſe-men; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this <hi>Ubequar,</hi> the Dominion came to <hi>Homar, Muhameds</hi> ſecond father-in-law; and theſe two in their times with their <hi>Moores</hi> gained all the Land of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Africk;</hi> and in this manner the Law or ſect of <hi>Muhamed</hi> hath ſpread it ſelf by force of Arms, not by doing Miracles, as the Law of Jeſus Chriſt did.</p>
               <p>The third cauſe whereby the Law or Sect of <hi>Muhamed</hi> hath augmented, was by the great promiſes which <hi>Muhamet</hi> made to the <hi>Moores,</hi> and which the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran</hi> promiſeth, that is to ſay, the glory of Paradiſe, as it is declared in the ninth Chapter; the <hi>Alcoran</hi> promiſeth that thoſe <hi>Moores</hi> which dye in War are not dead but living, and that they eat and drink; this he ſayes in the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Chapters of the firſt Book, in <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:169729:130"/>
thus, <hi>Oguale, &amp;c.</hi> (i. e.) Doe not think that thoſe who dye in War are dead, for they are living with their Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, eating and drinking; Wherefore the <hi>Moores</hi> when they make war, chooſe death as ſoon as life; and hereupon the <hi>Suné</hi> ſayes that none that dye in this world, when they are out of this life deſire to live here again, except thoſe which dye in battail, and thoſe (ſayes the <hi>Suné,)</hi> deſire to come again into this world, that they might dye again in battail, and enjoy again the great delight which they had in dying; and from theſt falſe promiſes it is, that the <hi>Moores</hi> to this day have fought ſo valiantly, and have gotten dominion over their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and beſides, he promiſeth them, that all the ſpoils ſhould be ſhared equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amongſt them, and ſo alſo I ſay, that if the King our Soveraign would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe this one thing unto thoſe who would goe beyond the Seas to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Moores,</hi> I dare promiſe before God, that in three years the Chriſtians would Conquer all <hi>Africa,</hi> and <hi>Aſia;</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:169729:130"/>
and this is the third cauſe whereby the Sect of the <hi>Moores</hi> hath increaſed, the which are againſt God and againſt our Neighbour, nor hath Jeſus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded any ſuch thing in his Goſpell, but Peace, Charity, and Mercy, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he will reward every one that ſhall deſerve it.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>O Moore,</hi> obſerve and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the propagation of thy Law, and by what means it was, and then obſerve the propagation of the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and how it is altogether founded upon Charity and Peace, without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of mens blood, without robbing, or turning any man out of his own; but <hi>Muhamed</hi> in the third Chapter of the ſecond Book ſaies, that they muſt expell their enemies out of their houſes, and behead them, and kill them.</p>
               <p>Now behold <hi>O Moore,</hi> the difference between theſe two Laws, and thou will know thy God and ſave thy ſoul.</p>
               <p>And the Diſciples of <hi>Muhamed</hi> did not only fight againſt their enemies, and expelled them from their habitations,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:169729:131"/>
and dominions, but alſo made War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, killing each other for to have the <hi>Califage</hi> and Kingdom, and ſo I ſay that (except <hi>Ubiquar,</hi> and <hi>Homar, Muhameds</hi> Fathers-in-Law, who dyed naturall deaths,) all the reſt killed each other; the firſt that dyed was <hi>Hoz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> whom <hi>Haly</hi> cauſed to be ſlain that he might be King. <hi>Haly</hi> alſo dyed in the ſame manner, one <hi>Moagua</hi> cauſing him to be killed, and the ſaid <hi>Moagua</hi> was ſlain by a ſon of <hi>Haly</hi> called <hi>Aho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceim,</hi> and he was alſo killed by another, and ſo one killed another ſucceſſively, to the number of thirty Caliphs; of whoſe differences, deaths, battails, and quarrels, there is a Book written which the <hi>Moores</hi> in <hi>Arabick</hi> call, <hi>Kitabu almu licu,</hi> (i. e.) The Book of the King, which Book they let none read but men of good years, but this Book is not like that which we call the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and thus <hi>Muhameds</hi> Sect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and ſpread by the three cauſes aforeſaid, and not by its own good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:169729:131"/>
Now conſider <hi>O Moore,</hi> the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, and what lives they lead after Jeſus Chriſts Aſcenſion, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and declaring the faith, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, without Armes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out envying each other, yea, only to exalt the faith of Jeſus Chriſt their Lord and Maſter they were perſecuted, and all dyed Martyrs, not as the Diſciples of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> who as we ſaid killed each other for dominion, and to be Princes in this world; but we muſt ſay as doth the Proverb, as was the Captain ſuch were his followers; the which more plainly appears when we ſay, that even as was our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Maſter, and as were his words, works, and admonitions, (full of purity, chaſtity, righteouſneſs, peace, and other graces of clemency, mercy, and piety, a friend to the poor, and humble) ſo alſo were his holy Diſciples, full of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and chaſtity, full of righteouſneſs, patience, charity, friends to the poor, peaceable, and humble, and left all that they had in the world to follow their
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:169729:132"/>
Maſter Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Preaching the Chriſtian Faith to all the world, cloathed in ſack-cloth, armed with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Holy Ghoſt, without kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or fighting, doing miracles, clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Leprous, healing the ſick, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, and blind, and raiſing the dead, as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> it ſelf teſtifies, and thus the holy Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted all the world, as <hi>David</hi> ſaies.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>There is no language, tongue or ſpeech,</l>
                  <l>Where their ſound is not heard,</l>
                  <l>In all the earth and Coaſts thereof</l>
                  <l>Their knowledge is conferd.</l>
               </q>
               <p>But this was not like <hi>Muhamed</hi> and his words and works, who was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether full of pride, vanity, vain glory, Luxury, Revenge, and Cruelty, deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all vertue, and charity, eſtranged and ſeparated from all mercy and pitty, full of vices, and void of chaſtity, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that all his thoughts and ſtudies, were nothing but to kill, rob, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged, and to expell men from their
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:169729:132"/>
Houſes, and Lands, Towns, and Cities, deſiring to make himſelf a great Lord in this world, that he might attain to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he deſired; and ſuch as he was ſuch were his Diſciples after him; full of pride, vanity, and vain glory, cruell, avaritious, and Vindicative; which appeared to be true by their carriage towards each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for one killed another, and others thoſe which followed to be revenged of each other, <hi>viz.</hi> The Fathers on the Children, and the Children on their Fathers, ſo that they were all murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, through their ambition to be Lords, Caliphs, Princes, and Kings.</p>
               <p>We read in the <hi>Suné,</hi> that <hi>Hoſman</hi> the third <hi>Caliph,</hi> &amp; <hi>Muhameds</hi> Son-in-Law, was ſlain by the ſword of <hi>Haly Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meds</hi> Couzen-german, which ſword was impoiſoned by <hi>Axa Muhameds</hi> wife, ſo that with <hi>Axa's</hi> aſſiſtance <hi>Haly</hi> to make himſelf <hi>Caliph,</hi> committed cruell murther, for we read in the <hi>Suné,</hi> that <hi>Hoſman</hi> was ſlain with the ſaid ſword in his own houſe, and when he was dead was caſt on a Dunghill, and there lay
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:169729:133"/>
three dayes, neither durſt any of his friends touch him, or carry away his dead Corps till it began to ſtink: I relate this for to ſhew the great cruelty which <hi>Muhameds.</hi> Diſciples did practiſe, and their little charity to this <hi>Hoſman</hi> who was <hi>Caliph,</hi> and <hi>Muhameds</hi> Diſciple, and his double ſon-in-Law (for he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed two of <hi>Muhameds</hi> daughters.) Likewiſe <hi>Haly</hi> the 4. <hi>Caliph</hi> was ſlain, by one of <hi>Hoſmans</hi> Kinſmen called <hi>Moa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua,</hi> who ſlew <hi>Haly</hi> whilſt he was making his <hi>Zala</hi> or prayer in the <hi>Moſque,</hi> and caſting him down, gave him ſuch a blow that he ſtruck his head from his ſhoulders; and this <hi>Mohagua</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Caliph,</hi> was killed by one of <hi>Halys</hi> ſons, called <hi>Alhuzemi,</hi> who was afterwards <hi>Caliph;</hi> And afterwards this <hi>Alhuzemi,</hi> who was ſon of <hi>Haly,</hi> and Nephew of <hi>Muhamed,</hi> that is to ſay, ſon of his daughter, was afterwards ſlain by a Kinſman of the ſaid <hi>Moagua's,</hi> who cauſed his head to be cut of, and laid in a Platter, and ſo had it ſerved up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall dayes at his table; and thus this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:169729:133"/>
and ſlaughter of the <hi>Caliphs</hi> continued until the 30th. <hi>Caliph,</hi> which I prove by the book above quoted cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quietebe Alimeme,</hi> that is, the Book of the <hi>Caliphs,</hi> and Kings, wherefore I conclude and ſay, as was the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſuch were the Diſciples; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Proverb ſaies well, when the head akes, all the Members are diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered alſo.</p>
               <p>For concluſion I will here inſert one Article which I forgot to ſet down in the Chapter of wives. You muſt know that <hi>Muhamed</hi> contracted marriage with the ſaid <hi>Axa,</hi> who was <hi>Ubequar's</hi> Daughter, when ſhe was ſix years old; and conſummated the ſaid Marriage with her, when ſhe was but eight years old; which thing I prove by the ſaid book <hi>Azar,</hi> upon which I would ask thee, <hi>O Moore,</hi> and would have thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve me, whether it was fit for <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> to conſummate Marriage with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle girle of eight years old? which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a homicide, and a ſin againſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, eſpecially in ſuch a man as <hi>Muha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,</hi>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:169729:134"/>
and who at that time had ſeven wives together. Speak, <hi>O Moore,</hi> in Gods Name, was it not a great vice? and was he not a man Luxurious beyond meaſure? wherefore, <hi>O Moore,</hi> I intreat thee to conſider all this above, for it is all ſpoken to give thee light, and to the end that thou mayeſt come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what thou doſt not underſtand; for the truth is, there are very few of the <hi>Alfaquies</hi> of the <hi>Moores,</hi> who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their own Law, and of the other <hi>Moores,</hi> not one; and I doe aſſure thee, that what I have written in this Book, is not of malice, but becauſe I thought it neceſſary to make and collect ſuch a diſcourſe, ſeeing I had received ability from God to doe it, and I render infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite thanks to God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for that he hath illuminated mee by the light of his grace, and hath drawn me from ſuch obſcurity, and ſo great Darkneſs, and therfore I ſay with the Prophet <hi>David</hi> this verſe, which he ſingeth;</p>
